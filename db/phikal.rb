    description: "The term \"M.U.\" pops up here and there in a\nlot of the earlier literature on these phenethylamines.  It stands for\n\"mescaline units\" and was used to give a quantitative measure for the\nrelative potency of a compound.  Since it became obvious quite early\nin these studies that mescaline, although the prototypic compound, was\nprobably going to remain the least potent, it seemed reasonable to use\nit as a bench mark of unity.  By dividing the dose needed of mescaline\n(to produce central effects) by the dose needed of another drug, one\nwould generate a number that represented just how many times more\npotent this new drug was than mescaline.  I used this term in a very\nearly review of the one-ring psychotomimetics, and it served\nsatisfactorily for quite a while.\n\n\nIts intrinsic worth proved, however, to be its very limitation.  It\nwas quickly apparent that the principal value, to behavioral\nresearchers, of the reports of new hallucinogenic drugs, was not in\nthe nature of their action but in the amount of stuff needed to\nproduce that action.  This was an essential axis against which the\nanimal pharmacologist could plot his findings.  A number was wanted,\nand the mescaline unit was just that number.  Sadly, the major\nquestion that is asked by most academic researchers in their\nevaluation of the psychedelic materials is, \"How much does it take,\"\nrather than \"What does it do.\" The marvelous nuances of action, the\nsubtle variations of effect, are dismissed as being hopelessly\nsubjective and thus without scientific worth.  But they are, I\nbelieve, of great worth.  That is exactly what this book is all about.",

A lot of work for a material without activity.\n\n\nI have used the term \"scrudge\" in this and other recipes, without\ndefining it.  With this aldehyde, as with most aldehydes in this\nnitrostyrene synthesis reaction where there is no ortho-substituent on\nthe benzaldehyde, the reaction progress should be carefully followed\nby thin-layer chromatography.  As the aldehyde disappears from the\nreaction mixture, the nitrostyrene appears, but there is usually the\ndevelopment of one or more slower moving components as seen by TLC.\nSuch a wrong-product is called scrudge.  The reaction should be\ncontinuously titrated, and stopped when there is a favorable balance\nbetween the aldehyde being mostly gone, the nitrostyrene being mostly\nmade, and the slower-moving scrudge components being not yet too\nplentiful.  Methylene chloride is an excellent solvent to try first,\nwith silica gel plates and UV detection.  The nitrostyrene is always\nthe fastest moving component of the reaction mixture and often\nfluoresces a dull purple.  The starting aldehyde is the second spot\nand usually fluoresces white or pale yellow.  The scrudge spots then\noccur in a cascade from the aldehyde to the origin.  A maddening\nproperty is that they are yellow or brown colored, and in the probe\nmass spectrograph they can crack to give rise to what appears to be\nthe right nitrostyrene.  Usually, they are high melting.\n\n\nIn this preparation, there was not one but several scrudges, and\nlittle if any nitrostyrene.  The same was true for the other of the\ndiethyl compounds such as 3-TASB, 5-TASB and 3-T-TRIS.

    description: "This entire venture into the study of TOMSO\nwas an outgrowth of the extraordinary response that had been shown by\none person to 5-TOM.  There were two obvious approaches that might\nthrow some light on the reason for this dramatic sensitivity.  One\nwould be to see if he was unusually capable of metabolizing\nsulfur-containing molecules, and the second would be to assume he was,\nand to try to guess just what product he had manu-factured with his\nliver.\n\n\nThe individual sensitivity question was addressed in a tidy and direct\nmanner.  Why not study a simple sulfur-containing model compound that\nwould probably be metabolized only at the sulfur and that would itself\nprobably be pharmacologically inactive in its own rights?  Sounded OK\nto me, so I made up a goodly supply of 4-tert-butyl thioanisole, which\nproved to be a gorgeous white crystalline solid.  It seemed quite\nlogical that this would be metabolized at the sulfur atom to produce\neither or both the sulfoxide and the sulfone.  So I treated a methanol\nsolution of this with a little hydrogen peroxide and distilled the\nneutral extracts at 100-115 °C at 0.2 mm/Hg to give the sulfoxide as a\nsolid that melted at 76-77 °C from hexane: Anal. (C11H16OS) C,H.  On\nthe other hand, if a solution of the thioanisole in acetic acid\ncontaining hydrogen peroxide was heated on the steam bath for a few\nhours and then worked up, a new solid was isolated that proved to be\nthe sulfone (a negative Fries-Vogt test).  This was obtained as white\ncrystals with a mp of 94-95 °C from aqueous methanol.  Anal.\n(C11H16SO2) C,H.  And I found that these three compounds separated\nwell from one another by GC, and that they could be extracted from\nurine.  Everything was falling into place.  My thought was to\ndetermine a safe (inactive) level of the parent thioanisole, and\ndetermine the distri-bution of metabolites in my urine, and then in\nthe urine of several other people, and then finally in the urine of\nthe person who was the intense reactor to 5-TOM.  I found that there\nwere no effects, either physical or psychological, at an oral dose of\n60 milligrams of 4-tert-butyl-thioanisole.  But then everything fell\napart.  There was not a detectable trace of anything, neither parent\ncompound nor either of the potential metabolites, to be found in my\nurine.  The material was obviously being completely converted to one\nor more metabolites, but the sulfoxide and sulfone were not among\nthem.  It would be fun, someday, to methodically trace the fate of\nthis compound.\n\n\nSo, on to the second approach.  What might the active metabolite of\n5-TOM actually be?  The sulfoxide seemed completely reasonable, and\nthat encouraged the synthesis of TOMSO.  This name was given, as it is\nthe sulfoxide analogue (SO) of 5-TOM.  And since only one of these\nanalogues has been made, the R5S distinction is not needed.  But it is\napparent that this approach to the finding of an explanation for the\nidiosyncratic sensitivity to 5-TOM also failed, in that TOMSO itself\nappeared to be without activity.\n\n\nBut the fallout of this study was the uncovering of an unusual\nproperty that alcohol can occasionally have when it follows the\ningestion of certain inactive drugs.  Or if it is used at the tail end\nof an experience with an active drug.  Usually some alcohol has been\nemployed as a softener of the residual effects of the day's\nexperiment, or as a social habit to accompany the post-mortem\ndiscussions of a day's experiences, and perhaps as a help to sleeping.\nBut if there is a rekindling of the effect, rather than the sedation\nexpected, then the verb \"to tomso\" can be used in the notes.  It\nrepresents the promotion of an inactive situation into an active one,\nwith the catalysis of alcohol.  But the effect is not that of alcohol.\nMight the extreme sensitivity of some alcoholics to even a small\namount of alcohol be due to some endogenous \"inactive\" factor that is\npromoted in this way into some centrally florid toxicity?  I remember\nseeing proposals of some tetrahydroisoquinolines as potential\nmis-metabolites in efforts to explain the toxicity of alcohol.  Maybe\nthey are nothing more than psychedelics that are thought to be\ninactive, but which might be ignited with a glass of wine.  And the\nperson is tomsoing with his small amount of alcohol.",

A large number of\nthe 2-carbon homologues are given names based on the code for the\n3-carbon compound.  On that basis, this should be 2C-TMA-2, since it\nis the 2-carbon counterpart of TMA-2.  But since the first of the\ntrimethoxyphenethylamines already had a trivial name, mescaline, the\ncode TMPEA was unassigned.  So, here is the logical place to use it.\n\n\nThere have been just two reports published of self-experimentation\nwith TMPEA, and these comments are taken from them.\n\n\nThe first is presented here, word for word, as it was originally\npublished (this was in 1931).  It leaves much to be desired.  The\nadministration was by injection (intramuscular injection?).  The dose\nwas not given, but it was less than those reported by Beringer in his\nstudies with mescaline, and this latter experimenter's published\nlevels were all between 300 and 500 milligrams.  What can one conclude\nfrom all this?  Only that TMPEA apparently did not measure up to\nmescaline in his comparisons.\n\n\nThe second, reported some 40 years later, is not really contradictory.\nHere the TMPEA was administered orally, and the subject surrounded\nhimself with a battery of psychological tests.  This might allow\nstatistics to provide an aura of validity to the observations.  But\nthe comments are pretty self-explanatory.  The drug was not active in\nits own right, but when employed preliminary to mescaline, greatly\nenhanced the effects of the latter.\n\n\nThis is an area of research that deserves more attention.  The simple\ncompound that results from the stripping of all three of the O-methyl\ngroups from TMPEA is the extremely potent neurotoxin,\n6-hydroxydopamine.  When it is ad-ministered to an otherwise intact\nexperimental animal, it produces sympathectomy, effectively destroying\nthe sympathetic nervous system.  And some of the methyl groups of\nTMPEA are known to be stripped off through the normal metabolic\nprocesses that occur in the liver.  There are many fascinating\npsychedelics that have a signature of methoxyl groups para to\none-another.  It is known that they, too, can lose a methyl group or\ntwo.  It would be intriguing to see if there was some biochemical\noverlap between the metabolism of some of these centrally active drugs\nand the metabolic fate of 6-hydroxydopamine.

Then, perhaps, 4T-MMDA-2\nshould be somewhat more potent than MMDA-2.  Which is where the trials\nhave gone to, and the absence of effects therefore declares that line\nof reasoning invalid.  What else could be used for clues?  The whole\nbenzofuran project, which had the same cyclic nature, was without\nactivity.

The\n2,5-dimethoxy aspect has been kept intact, and modifications in the\n4-position have given rise to treasures such as DOM, DOB, DOET, DOI,\nand the Aleph compounds.  And, of course, the entire world of the\n2C-X's has exploited this same orientation.\n\n\nHere, there is the blatant, parallel call from TMA-6.  It can serve,\nas the 2,4,6-counterpart, as a similar template compound.  And the\nfirst indicators are that, in keeping the 2,6-dimethoxy aspect intact,\na completely analogous series could be made, again with modifications\nof the 4-position.  These have been named the psu-series, or\npsi-series, as an abbreviation for the prefix, pseudo, and can be\ndifferentiated from the 2,4,5-things with the use of the Greek letter\n\"Psi\".  Thus there is the psi-DOM (called Z-7 in this book, and certainly\nan active compound), and psi-DOB, psi-DOET, psi-DOI, and the psi-ALEPH\ncompounds.  And, of course, the psi-2C-X counterparts.  I would expect\nall of them to be active and, certainly, some of them interesting.\nThey will be considerably more difficult to synthesize.  However, some\nof them, specifically things such as psi-2C-T-4, have already been\nprepared, and are being evaluated.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the guiding premises of this Book II was to make all recipes\nemploy commercially available materials as starting materials.  And in\nthe case of TMA-6, the required benzaldehyde\n(2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde) is an easily obtained trade item from\nany of several supply houses.  Why not start the recipe there?  Why\ntell how to make it from 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (also presently\navailable from commercial sources) and how to make the ether in turn,\nfrom phloroglucinol?  This simply reflects a valid paranoia of our\ntimes.  Today the aldehyde is available (at $2/g) and can be easily\npurchased.  But tomorrow?  What about in the year 2003?  Who can tell\nwhat will, or will not, be easily available then?  There might be a\nworld-wide acknowledgment that the \"war on drugs\" is more destructive\nthan any drug itself could ever be, and every law that had been\nwritten in the attempt to dictate human behavior will have been\ntransformed into a force that truly educates and allows choice.  This\nmight really happen.  But maybe, on the other hand, no fine chemicals\nmay be permitted to be held in any hands, at any price, except for\nthose of licensed chemists and in authorized laboratories.  The black\nmarket price for the aldehyde might be $1000/g with another $1000 for\nprotection.\n\n\nBut, it will be impossible to remove phloroglucinol from availability.\nIt is available as a natural component in the free form, in sources as\ndiverse as the cones of the Sequoia sempervirens (the coast redwood\ntree) and species of Camillia (that provides the leaves of our morning\ntea).  And combined with a molecule of glucose in the form of its\nglucoside, it is called phlorin, and it is present in the discarded\nrinds of almost all citrus fruits as well as the resins from many of\nthe Eucalyptus species.  And one step yet further back into nature,\nthere is a dihydrochalcone glucoside called phloridzin which\npractically drips out of all parts of the apple and pear trees except\nfor the apple or pear itself.  It, on base hydrolysis, gives phlorin,\nwhich on acid hydrolysis gives phloroglucinol, which when dissolved in\nmethanol and sulfuric acid gives Q.  Nature is indeed most bountiful.\n\n\nThe phenethylamine homologue of TMA-6 is well known, but is virtually\nunexplored pharmacologically.  The above benzaldehyde with\nnitromethane in glacial acetic acid containing ammonium acetate gave\nthe appropriate beta-nitrostyrene as yellow crystals with a mp\n177-177.5 °C.  This, with LAH in ether, gave\n2,4,6-trimethoxyphenethylamine (2,4,6-TMPEA, or 2C-TMA-6) as the\npicrate salt (mp 204-205 °C) or the hydrochloride salt (mp 234-235\n°C).  It has been shown not to be a substrate to the soluble amine\noxidase from rabbit liver, a property it shares with mescaline, but\nwhether it is or is not active in man is at present unknown.",

    description: "TMA-5, as was the case with TMA-4, has only\nbeen superficially explored.  The above two quotations are from two\ndifferent people, and together no more than hint at the possibility\nthat it might be active in the several tens of milligrams.\n\n\nPharmacologists have developed quite an art in the design and\nevaluation of animal behavior models for the study of psychedelic\ndrugs.  They have always faced two formidable tasks, however.  There\nis the qualitative question: is the drug a psychedelic?  And there is\nthe quantitative question: how potent is it?\n\n\nThe first question is addressed by taking a number of known\npsychedelic drugs, and searching for some animal responses that are\ncommon to all.  Since there is little logic in the argument that\nanimals can experience, let alone reveal, altered states of\nconsciousness or fantasy fugues or colored imagery, the investigator\nmust look for objective signs such as conditioned responses to\nstimuli, or unusual behavior.  If one explores ten drugs that are\nknown psychedelics, and all ten produce, say, bizarre nest-building\nbehavior in mice, and an eleventh drug of unknown pharmacology does\nexactly the same thing, then the eleventh drug can be suspected of\nbeing a psychedelic drug.\n\n\nAnd the second question, how potent, is answered by seeing how much of\nthe drug is required to evoke this standardized behavior.  This is\ncalled the dose-response curve, in which the more drug you give, the\nmore response you get.  This curve gives confidence that the drug is\nindeed responsible for the activity that is seen, as well as giving a\nquantitative measure of that activity.\n\n\nBut this entire discipline depends on the acceptance of the fact that\nthe first ten drugs are indeed psychedelic materials.  And these\ninputs can only come from human trials.  What is the validity of these\nassumptions with TMA-5?  Not very good.  The statement that it is\npsychedelic has actually been published in reviews solely on the basis\nof the above two studies; the potency has been put at some ten times\nthat of mescaline.  Mescaline is certainly an effective psychedelic\ndrug in the 300-500 milligram range, and this factor of ten implies\nthat TMA-5 is also a psychedelic drug and is active in the 30-50\nmilligram range.  And indeed, both statements may be true, but\nconfidence in these conclusions must await more extensive trials.\n\n\nThe two-carbon analogue of TMA-5 is 2,3,6-trimethoxyphenethylamine (or\n2C-TMA-5 or 2,3,6-TMPEA).  This is a known material, although there\nhas been some controversy as to its physical properties.  It has been\nstudied in monoamine oxidase systems, and appears to be either a\ncompetitive substrate or an inhibitor of that enzyme.  But as far as I\nknow, no one has nibbled it, so its human activity is unknown.",

    description: "That is the sum total of the knowledge of\nsubjective effects that exist.  There was such a precious small amount\nof the final hydrochloride salt that, by the time the needed build-up\nof dosage had been completed, there was just enough left for this\nsingle trial, which was conducted in South America.  Based upon the\nvolunteered comparisons to LSD and TMA, a potency for this compound\nhas been published that states that it is 4x the potency of mescaline,\nor 4 M.U.  The material must be re-synthesized, and re-evaluated with\nthe now-accepted protocol.\n\n\nIn the future re-synthesis, there will be a considerable improvement\nmade with the several steps that are described above.  The products\nfrom the preparations of the phenol, the allyl ether, the Claisen\nrearrangement, the methylation of the new phenol, and the\nisomerization to the mixture of cis- and trans-propenylbenzenes were\nall conducted without the benefit of a Kugel-Rohr apparatus.  The\nproducts became progressively thick and blacker, and it was only by\nthe grace of getting a solid at the trans-propenyl stage that some\ndegree of purity could finally be obtained.  All of the intermediates\nare certainly white oils, and when this preparation is repeated, they\nwill be distilled at each and every stage.\n\n\nThis 2,3,5-orientation of the methoxy groups on the aromatic ring is\nfar and away the most difficult tri-substitution pattern known to\nchemists.  There just isn't any simple way to put it together.  The\n2-carbon phenethylamine (2,3,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) had been\nsynthesized quite a while ago.  Its role as a substrate for liver\namine oxidase in in vitro studies has been explored, but it has never\nbeen tried in man.  Even more bizarre is the amphetamine with this\noxygenation pattern, in which a methylenedioxy ring has replaced the\ntwo adjacent methoxyl groups.  This is the material\n2,3-methylenedioxy-5-methoxyamphetamine, or MMDA-4.  Despite its\ntheoretical appeal (being one of the six possible MMDA derivatives)\nand it's synthetic challenge (as with the 2,3,5-trimethoxy things\nabove, everything is simply in the wrong position) the compound is of\nunknown pharmacology.  This follows, quite logically, from the fact\nthat it has never been synthesized.  No one has yet put together a\nworkable procedure that would make it.  In the course of making all\npossible positional isomers of MMDA explicitly Schedule I drugs, the\nDEA has named this compound, and since it was specifically named, it\nwas entered into the Chemical Abstracts.  So it is listed in the\nliterature, at least it is in the Chem. Abstracts.  But it is in\nreality completely unknown.  Some day, some one somewhere will have a\nlight bulb go on over his head, and find a synthetic process that will\nmake it.  Of course, the moment it is made, an illegal act will have\noccurred, at least in the United States as long as the present laws\nremain unchanged, as it is currently a Schedule I drug.\n\n\nNeedless to say, the 2-carbon analog of MMDA-4,\n2,3-methylenedioxy-5-methoxyphenethylamine (would 2C-MMDA-4 be a\nreasonable name?) is also unknown.",

All that can be said is that trials were made\n(in this case using three separate individuals) at an oral level of\n100 milligrams.  And, at this level, nothing happened.  And since a\nbottom threshold for mescaline would be perhaps 200 milligrams, it can\nbe honestly said that the activity of this compound, if expressed\nrelative to mescaline (using mescaline units) is less than 2 M.U.

    description: "There was absolutely no reason to suspect\nthat the simple rearrangement of the methoxy groups of TMA from the\nclassic 3,4,5-positions to this new, 2,4,5-orientation, would\ndramatically increase potency like this.  Mescaline,\n3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine, is an extraordinary compound, but it\nis not particularly potent, requiring hundreds of milligrams for a\ntrip.  And going from its 3,4,5-pattern to the 2,4,5-pattern of TMPEA\nmakes the compound even less potent.  There was essentially nothing\nreported in the scientific literature about central activity of\n2,4,5-substituted stuff, so there could not have been any logical\npreparation for the activity of TMA-2.  My very first trials were with\na rather liberal 400 micrograms, and the levels being explored leaped\nup in fairly large steps, mostly on separate days.  On November 26,\n1962, at 6:00 AM, when 12 milligrams proved to be inactive, another 12\nmilligrams went in and down an hour later.  This was the 24 milligram\ndiscovery experiment, a fragment of which is given above.  The anxiety\nof being thrust into the unknown certainly played a role in what can\nnow be seen as obvious psychosomatic difficulties.\n\n\nThe unexpected ten-fold increase of effectiveness uncovered by the\nsimple relocation of a single methoxy group of TMA gave the further\njuggling of methoxy groups a very high priority.  There are a total of\nsix arrangements possible for the three groups, namely, 3,4,5- (the\noriginal TMA), 2,4,5- (the present TMA-2), and then and in systematic\nsequence, 2,3,4-, 2,3,5-, 2,3,6-, and 2,4,6.  These compounds were\ntotally unknown at that time, and they could and would be assigned the\nsequential names TMA-3, TMA-4, TMA-5 and TMA-6, respectively.  I made\nthem all, and they are all included in this book.\n\n\nHaving found the treasure of 2,4,5-ness, it is instructive to look\nback at nature, to see what its plant equivalents might be.  There are\nindeed a few essential oils that have their methoxy groups in this\narrangement.  TMA-2 is thus one of the Essential Amphetamines, and\nmost of the botanical connections are discussed under TMA.  The\nnatural skeleton is found in asarone, with alpha-asarone being\ntrans-propenyl, beta-asarone the cis-propenyl and gamma-asarone (also\ncalled euasarone) being the allyl-isomer.  I had mentioned, in the\nspice cabinet discussion under TMA, the tasting of asarone at up to 70\nmilligrams without any effects.\n\n\nA couple of additional experiments involving TMA-2 had been set up and\nstarted, but somehow never had enough fire to get completed.  Studies\non the optical isomers had gotten up to assays of 6 milligrams on each\nof the separate isomers, but had never been taken higher.  The \"R\"\nisomer is much the more potent in rabbit assays, but the human\ncomparisons remain unknown at present.  Also, a study of the 14C\nlabeled racemate (5 microcuries in 40 milligrams) was conducted with a\nview to metabolite analysis, but again, the project was abandoned\nbefore any results were obtained.  In the rat, the 4-methoxyl carbon\nappeared as expired carbon dioxide to the extent of about 20%.  And\nthis is some four times the amount seen from either of the other two\nmethoxyl carbon atoms.\n\n\nOne final memory in the TMA-2 area.  About twenty years ago I\nco-authored a rather thorough review article in the British journal\nNature, that described the structure-activity relationships between\nthe simpler one-ringed psychotomimetics.  It also quietly served as a\nvehicle for mentioning a number of newly-discovered compounds and\ntheir human activities.  But as a magnificent attestment to youth and\nbrashness, we proposed a complex compound that embraced each and every\nclue and hint that might tie it to the neurological process.  This\nhybrid monster was 2,beta-dihydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.  It had\neverything.  The 6-hydroxydopamine hydroxy group and the rest of the\ndopamine molecule intact as represented by the two methoxyl groups.\nAnd the beta-hydroxy group gave it the final \"norepinephrine\" touch.\nAnd, with due modesty, we proposed that it might be \"an endogenous\npsychotogen.\" Why not \"the endogenous psychotogen?\" And then, to\ncompound the picture, what should arrive in the mail a month or two\nlater, and from a most respected scientist, but a sample of just this\nstuff, synthesized for our investigations.  I must have bought a\nlittle of my own promotion, as I noted that even after my first four\ngraded dosages with the compound, I was still only up to a 250\nmicrogram dose.  And then, as the sample became increasingly brown and\nwas clearly decomposing, the project was finally abandoned.\n\n\nA sad note on how things have changed since that time.  I recently\nqueried the editors of Nature, about their thoughts concerning a\ntwenty year retrospective of this area, written by the three authors\nof the original review.  We had each followed quite divergent paths,\nbut each of us was still keenly the researcher.  It would have been a\nmarvelous paper to put together, and it would have delighted the\nreading audience of Nature, had it been the audience of twenty years\nago.  But not today.  The journal is now dedicated to neutron stars\nand x-ray sources.  The respected old English journal of\ninterdisciplinary interests is not the grand and curious lady she used\nto be.  The Editor's reply was polite, but negative.  \"Such an article\nwould be unsuitable for publication in Nature at present,\" they said.\nAnd, I am sad to say, they're right.\n\n\nAnd I am afraid that the American counterpart journal, Science, has\nsuffered a similar deterioration.  It, too, has abandoned\nmultidisciplinary interest, but in a different direction.  They are\nnow dedicated to chromosomes, and nucleotide identification, and are\ntotally captivated by the attention paid to, and the apparent\nimportance of, the human genome project.  There is where you\nautomatically go to publish, now, if you have unraveled some DNA\nsequence from the Latvian cockroach.",

    description: "TMA was the very first totally synthetic\npsychedelic phenethylamine that was found to be active in man, for\nwhich there had been any attempt to describe such drug effects in any\ndetail.  This was the report of research done in Canada, and it\nappeared in 1955, six years before my own report on the material.\nThere was an earlier report on TMPEA which is mentioned in the\nappropriate recipe, but there were few details given.  Also there had\nbeen interest in reports that adrenalin that had become old and\ndiscolored seemed to elicit central effects in man.  The oxidation\nproducts were identified as the deeply colored indolic compound\nadrenochrome and the colorless analogue adrenolutin.  The controversy\nthat these reports created just sort of died away, and the\nadrenochrome family has never been accepted as being psychedelic.  No\none in the scientific community today is looking in and about the\narea, and at present this is considered as an interesting historical\nfootnote.  But, in any case, they are not phenethylamines and so not\npart of this book.\n\n\nThe Canadian studies with TMA involved the use of a stroboscope as a\ntool for the induction of visual phenomena.  These experiments used\nlevels in the 50-150 milligram range, and generally employed\npre-treatment with Dramamine for the successful prevention of nausea.\nThere was reported giddiness and light-headedness, and some remarkable\nflash-induced visualizations.  With higher levels, the visual\nsyntheses are present without external stimulation.  But there is a\nthread of negativity that seems to pervade the experience at these\nhigher levels, and the appearance of a publication that emphasized the\npossible antisocial nature to TMA seemed to discourage further medical\nexploration.  Military interest was maintained however, apparently, as\nTMA became a part of the chemical warfare studies where it was\nreferred to with the code name EA-1319.  It had been used in human\ntrials with psychiatric patients, but no details of these experiments\nhave been published.\n\n\nThe presence of a potentially active impurity in TMA deserves some\ncomment.  In the Canadian work, the material used was described as\nmelting at 219-220 °C, which is the property given for the\nimpurity-free material above.  If this was the actual material used in\nthose studies, this impurity (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyamphetamine) was\nprobably not present.  The Army studies use a material of unreported\nmelting point.  In my own studies, the lower melting product was used.\nThere is an intriguing and unanswered question: what contribution did\nthis phenolic component make to the nature of the observed effects of\nTMA?  Assays on the isolated contaminant could answer that, but they\nhave not yet been made.\n\n\nThere is an old saying that has gotten many people into trouble: \"If\none is good, then two is better.\" And if a statement of the measure of\nworth of a compound can be made from its potency, then TMA is a step\nin the right direction.  And this was a chemically simple direction to\nfollow further.  Looking at mescaline as a compound with no carbons on\nits side-chain, and TMA as a mescaline molecule with one carbon on its\nside chain, then what about a compound with two carbons there, or\nthree, or nine carbons?\n\n\nUsing this pattern of naming, TMA can be seen as\nalpha-methylmescaline, or AMM.  And the two carbon homologue would be\nalpha-ethyl mescaline, or AEM.  Its proper name is\n2-amino-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)butane.  It and its several higher\nhomologues are discussed in a separate recipe entry called AEM (#1).\n\n\nA final comment.  But maybe a long one!  Elsewhere, I have made\ncomparisons between myristicin and MMDA, and between safrole and MDA.\nAnd here there is a similar parallel between elemicin and TMA.  What\nare these relationships between the essential oils and the\namphetamines?  In a word, there are some ten essential oils that have\na three carbon chain, and each lacks only a molecule of ammonia to\nbecome an amphetamine.  So, maybe these essential oils, or \"almost\"\namphetamines, can serve as an index for the corresponding real\namphetamine counterparts.  I had originally called this family the\n\"natural\" amphetamines, but my son suggested calling them the\n\"essential\" amphetamines, and I like that.  At the time that I had\nsynthesized TMA, back there in the '50s, I had the impulse to explore\nthis body of Essential Amphetamines.  As the old folk-wisdom says:\n\"Nature is trying to tell us something.\"\n\n\nOne of the banes of the archivist is having to choose one pattern of\norganization over another.  The book store owned by a language scholar\nwill have the German poets and playwrights and novelists here, and the\nFrench ones over there.  Next door, the book store is run by a letters\nscholar, and the poetry of the world is here, and the plays of the\nworld are there, regardless of the language of origin.  The same\nobtains with spices, and essential oils, and amphetamines.  The spice\ncabinet is a rich source of chemical treasures, each source plant\ncontaining a host of com-pounds, some of which are true essential\noils.  And the next spice from the next plant has some of the same\ncomponents and some new ones.  Does one organize by plant (spice or\nherb) or by essential oil (amphetamine)?  Let's do it by the ring\nsubstitution pattern of the amphetamine, and gather the spices and\noils as a secondary collection.\n\n\n(1) The 4-methoxy pattern.  The pivotal essential oil is\n4-allylanisole, or methyl chavicol, or estragole (called esdragol in\nthe old literature).  This allyl compound is found in turpentine,\nanise, fennel, bay, tarragon, and basil.  Its smell is light, and\nreminiscent of fennel. The propenyl analogue is called anethole, or\nanise camphor, and it is found in both anise and camphor.  It is a\nwaxy solid, and has a very intense smell of anise or fennel.  At low\nconcentrations, it is sweet, as in magnolia blossoms, where it is also\nfound.  The drinks that turn cloudy with water dilution (Pernod-like\nliqueurs, and ouzo and roki), are heavy with it, since it was the\nnatural flavoring in the original absinthe.  That drink was very\npopular in the last century, as an intoxicant which produced an\naltered state of consciousness beyond that which could be ascribed to\nalcohol alone.  It contained wormwood, which proved to be\nneurologically damaging.  The flavorings, such as anethole, are still\nbig things in synthetic liqueurs such as vermouth.  Old anethole, when\nexposed to air and light, gets thick and sticky and yellowish, and\nbecomes quite disagreeable to taste.  Maybe it is polymerizing, or\nmaybe oxidizing to stuff that dimerizes.  Whatever.  These changes are\nwhy old spices in the cabinet are best discarded.  And adding ammonia\nto any of these natural product oils produces, in principle,\n4-methoxyamphetamine, 4-MA.\n\n\n(2) The 3,4-dimethoxy pattern.  The main actor here is methyleugenol,\nor 4-allyl-1,2-dimethoxybenzene.  This is located in almost every item\nin the spice cabinet.  It is in citronella, bay (which is laurel,\nwhich is myrtle), pimiento, allspice, pepper, tree-tea oil, and on and\non.  It has a faint smell of cloves, and when dilute is immediately\nmistaken for carnations.  The propenyl analogue is, not unreasonably,\nmethylisoeugenol, a bit more scarce, and seems to always be that\nlittle minor peak in any essential oil analysis.  The compounds\nmissing that methyl group on the 4-oxygen are famous.  The allyl\nmaterial is eugenol, 4-allylguaiacol, and it is in cinnamon, nutmeg,\ncloves, sassafras and myrrh.  You taste it and it burns.  You smell it\nand think immediately of cloves.  And its property as an anesthetic,\nin the form of a clove, is well known in the folk-treatment of\ntoothaches.  Actually, flowers of clove (the gillyflower, like the\ncarnation) are the small, pointy things that decorate baked hams and,\nwhen stuck into apples, make pomander balls.  This anesthetic property\nhas recently led to a drug abuse fad, called clove cigarettes.  Very\nstrong, very flavorful, and very corrosive things from Southeast Asia.\nThe eugenol that is present numbs the throat, and allows many strong\ncigarettes to be smoked without pain.  The propenyl analogue is\nisoeugenol, with a smell that is subtle but very long lasting, used\nmore in soaps and perfumes than in foods.  The amine addition to the\nmethyleugenol world produces 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, or 3,4-DMA.\nThe isomer with the other methyl group missing is chavibetol\n(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyallylbenzene) and is found in the pepper leaf that\nis used with betel nut.  A couple of positional rearrangement isomers\nof methyleugenol are known in the plant world.  The 2,4-isomer is\ncalled osmorrhizole, and the conjugated form is isoosmorrhizole or\nnothosmyrnol; both are found in carrot-like vegetables.  They, with\nammonia, would give 2,4-DMA.  And the 3,5-dimethoxyallylbenzene isomer\nfrom artemisia (a pungent herb commonly called mugwort) and from sage,\nwould give rise to 3,5-DMA.  This is an unexplored isomer which would\nbe both an antidote for opium as well as a stimulant, if the classical\nreputation of mugwort is transferred to the amphetamine.\n\n\n(3) The 3,4-methylenedioxy pattern.  One of the most famous essential\noils is safrole, or 4-allyl-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene.  This is the\nmainstay of sassafras oil, and it and its conjugated isomer isosafrole\nhave a smell that is immediately familiar: root beer!  These are among\nthe most widely distributed essential oils, being present in most of\nthe spices, including the heavies such as cinnamon and nutmeg.  I am\nnot aware of the 2,3-isomer ever having been found in nature.  Adding\nammonia to either would give MDA.\n\n\n(4) The 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy pattern.  The parent compound is\nmyristicin, 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene, and the\nsource of this is nutmeg (or the botanically parallel material, mace).\nThe nutmeg is the seed of the tree Myristica fragrans and mace is the\nfibrous covering of the seed.  The two spices are virtually identical\nas to their chemical composition.  Myristicin and the conjugated\nisomer isomyristicin are also found in parsley oil, and in dill.  This\nwas the oil that was actually shown to be converted to MMDA by the\naddition of ammonia by passage through an in vitro liver preparation.\nSo here is the major justification for the equation between the\nessential oils and the Essential Amphetamines.  Care must be taken to\nmake an exact distinction between myristicin (this essential oil) and\nmyristin (the fat) which is really trimyristin or glyceryl\ntrimyristate from nutmeg and coconut.  This is the fat from myristic\nacid, the C-14 fatty acid, and these two similar names are often\ninterchanged even in the scientific literature.\n\n\n(5) The 2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy pattern.  This is the second of\nthe three natural methoxy methylenedioxy orientations.  Croweacin is\n2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyallylbenzene, and it takes its name from\nthe binomial for the plant Eriostemon crowei from the worlds of rue\nand the citrus plants.  It corresponds to the essential amphetamine\nMMDA-3a.  This oil is found in plants of the Family Rutaceae.  My\nmemories of this area of botany are of Ruta graveolens, the common\nrue, whose small leaves smelled to me, for all the world, like cat\nurine.  This plant has always fascinated me because of a most\nremarkable recipe that I was given by a very, very conservative\nfellow-club member, one evening, after rehearsal.  He told me of a\nformula that had provided him with the most complete relief from\narthritic pain he had ever known.  It was a native decoction he had\nlearned of many years eariler, when he was traveling in Mexico.  One\ntook equal quantities of three plants, Ruta graveolens (or our common\nrue), Rosmarinus officinalis (better known as rosemary), and Cannabis\nsativa (which is recognized in many households simply as marijuana).\nThree plants all known in folklore, rue as a symbol for repentance,\nrosemary as a symbol of remembrance, and pot, well, I guess it is a\nsymbol of a lot of things to a lot of people.  Anyway, equal\nquantities of these three plants are allowed to soak in a large\nquantity of rubbing alcohol for a few weeks.  Then the alcoholic\nextracts are clarified, and allowed to evaporate in the open air to a\nthick sludge.  This then was rubbed on the skin, where the arthritis\nwas troublesome, and always rubbed in the direction of the extremity.\nIt was not into, but onto the body that it was applied.  All this from\na very conservative Republican friend!\n\n\nThe methoxy-methylenedioxy pattern is also found in nature with the\n2,4,5-orientation pattern.  The allyl-2,4,5-isomer is called asaricin.\nIt, and its propenyl-isomer, carpacin, are from the Carpano tree which\ngrows in the Solomon Islands.  All these plants are used in folk\nmedicine.  These two systems, the 2,3,4- and the 2,4,5-orientations,\npotentially give rise, with ammonia, to MMDA-3a and MMDA-2.\n\n\n(6) The 3,4,5-trimethoxy pattern.  Elemicin is the well studied\nessential oil, 5-allyl-1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, primarily from the oil\nof elemi.  It is, like myristicin, a component of the Oil of Nutmeg,\nbut it is also found in several of the Oils of Camphor, and in the\nresin of the Pili in the Philippines.  This tree is the source of the\nOil of Elemi.  I had found a trace component in nutmeg many years ago\nthat proved to be 5-methoxyeugenol, or elemicin without the 4-methyl\ngroup; it is also present in the magnolia plant.  The aldehyde that\ncorresponds to this is syringaldehyde, and its prefix has been spun\ninto many natural products.  Any natural product with a syring\nsomewhere in it has a hydroxy between two methoxys.  The amphetamine\nbase from elemicin or isoelemicin would be TMA, the topic of this very\nrecipe.\n\n\n(7) The 2,4,5-trimethoxy pattern.  There is an essential oil called\nasarone that is 2,4,5-trimethoxy-1-propenylbenzene.  It is the trans-\nor alpha-isomer, and the cis-isomer is known as beta-asarone.  It is\nthe isomerization analogue of the much more rare\n1-allyl-2,4,5-trimethoxybenzene, gamma-asarone, or euasarone, or\nsekishone.  Asarone is the major component of Oil of Calamus obtained\nfrom the rhizomes of Acorus calamus, the common Sweet Flag that grows\nwild on the edges of swamps throughout North America, Europe, and\nAsia.  It has been used as a flavoring of liqueurs and, as almost\nevery other plant known to man, has been used as a medicine.  In fact,\nin Manitoba this plant was called Rat-root by the Cree Indians in the\nLake Winnipeg area known as New Iceland, and Indian-root by the\nIcelandic pioneers.  It was used externally for the treatment of\nwounds, and internally for most illnesses.  There apparently is no\nreport of central effects.  The corresponding propanone, acoramone (or\n2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetone), is also present in Oil of Calamus.\nThe styrene that corresponds to asarone is found in a number of\nplants, and is surprisingly toxic to brine shrimp.  The older\nliterature describes an allyl-trimethoxy benzene called calamol, but\nit has never been pinned down as to structure.  The isolation of\ngamma-asarone or euasarone from Oil of Xixin (from wild ginger) has\ngiven rise to a potential problem of nomenclature.  One of the Genus\nnames associated with wild ginger is Asiasarum which looks very much\nlike the name asarone, which comes from the Genus Acorus.  And a\nsecond Genus of medical plants also called wild ginger is simply\ncalled Asarum.  There is an Asarum forbesi from central China, and it\nis known to give a pleasant smell to the body.  And there is Asarum\nseiboldi which is largely from Korea and Manchuria.  It has many\nmedical uses, including the treatment of deafness, epilepsy, and\nrheumatism.  The amphetamine that would arise from this natural\ntreasure chest is TMA-2.\n\n\n(8) The 2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy pattern.  The parent allyl\nbenzene is apiole (with a final \"e\") or parsley camphor, and it is the\nmajor component of parsley seed oil.  Its conjugated isomer is called\nisoapiole, and they are valuable as the chemical precurors to the\namination product, DMMDA.  Whereas both of these essential oils are\nwhite solids, there is a green oily liquid that had been broadly used\nyears ago in medicine, called green, or liquid apiol (without the\nfinal \"e\").  It comes from the seeds of parsley by ether extraction,\nand when the chlorophyll has been removed, it is known as yellow\napiol.  With the fats removed by saponification and distillation, the\nold term for the medicine was apiolin.  I would assume that any of\nthese would give rise to white, crystalline apiole on careful\ndistillation, but I have never tried to do it.  The commercial Oil of\nParsley is so readily available.\n\n\n(9) The 2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy pattern.  The second of the\nthree tetraoxygenated essential oils is\n1-allyl-2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene, commonly called\ndillapiole and it comes, not surprisingly, from the oils of any of the\nseveral dill plants around the world.  It is a thick, almost colorless\nliquid, but its isomerization product, isodillapiole, is a white\ncrystalline product which melts sharply.  This, by the theoretical\naddition of ammonia, gives DMMDA-2.\n\n\n(10) The tetramethoxy pattern.  The third and last of the\ntetra-oxygenated essential oils, is\n1-allyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene.  This is present as a minor\ncomponent in the oil of parsley, but it is much more easily obtained\nby synthesis.  It, and its iso-compound, and the amination product,\nare discussed under the last of theTen Essential Amphetamines, TA.\n\n\nOne must remember that the term \"essential\" has nothing to do with the\nmeaning of needed, or required.  The word's origin is essence,\nsomething with an odor or smell.  Thus, the essential oils are those\noils that have a fragrance, and the Essential Amphetamines are those\ncompounds that can, in principle, be made from them by the addition of\nammonia in the body.\n\n\nThere were a few interesting experimental trials that were based on\nthese natural oils.  Methoxyeugenol was assayed up to a 10 milligram\nlevel, and asarone at up to a 70 milligram level, and neither had any\neffects at all.  And, in an attempt to challenge the\n\"oil-to-amphetamine\" concept, I made up a mixture of 1 part MDA, 2\nparts TMA and 5 parts MMDA.  A total of 100 milligrams of this\ncombination (which I had named the \"Pseunut Cocktail\" for\npseudo-nutmeg) should be equivalent to the safrole, elemicin and\nmyristicin that would be in 5 grams of nutmeg.  And 100 milligrams\nindeed produced quite a sparkle and considerable eye-dilation.  But\nthen, I have never taken 5 grams of nutmeg, so I cannot make any\ncomparisons.",

Walking was described as a floating\nprocedure, and one could tilt to one side or the other if care was not\ntaken.  Anorexia was occasionally noted, and most people commented on\nsome degree of anesthesia to touch.\n\n\nAll in all, this drug evoked a mixed bag of responses.  The most\nstartling and unexpected property was the dramatic increase in potency\nover the parent prototype, mescaline.  The substitution of a sulfur\natom for an oxygen atom increased the power of the drug some ten-fold,\nwithout any apparent decrease in complexity of action.  As there were\nmany materials that were outgrowths of mescaline with the studies of\nethyl this and diethyl that, each and all of these would be\ninteresting candidates for synthesis with this or that oxygen atom\nreplaced with sulfur.  Most of these have been made, and many of them\nhave proven to be interesting.\n\n\nWhat is meaning of the phrase, \"sulfur-for-oxygen replacement?\" Let me\ntry to explain it for non-chemists.\n\n\nOne of the most exciting bits of architecture in science is the\nPeriodic Table.  The principles of electrons and orbitals and\ndifferent counts of protons in a nucleus gets to be a complex story to\ntry to explain the grid-like structure of the arrangements of atoms.\nIt is easier to simply give the music.  And this melody goes: As you\nlook across a row, elements are simple in their binding arrangements\non the left, become more complex towards the center where they kind of\nchange polarity, and then get progressively simple again but with the\nopposite charge as you approach the right-hand side.\n\n\nAnd when you look at a column from top to bottom, the bonding\ncomplexity stays pretty much the same but the atom gets more and more\nmassive as you go down the column.\n\n\nThe combinations of atoms from the Periodic Table, by and large, is\nthe province of the inorganic chemist.  Take one of this, and two of\nthat, and the combination is called a salt, or a complex, or an\nadduct, and probably has interesting colors, and may even be found in\nnature as part of a rock somewhere, or coming out of the vent of a\nvolcano.\n\n\nBut if one were to look at just four elements, three in the middle\nright of the first row, namely carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and the\none up there at the top and the lightest of all, hydrogen, you would\nfind quite a different story.  These can be combined in an infinity of\nways since there can be dozens of atoms hooked to one-another; this is\nthe territory of the organic chemist, and this is the chemistry of\nlife.  With a few exceptions, every molecule within the body, and the\nfood that maintains the body, and the drugs that affect the body, are\nmade up of a bunch of carbons, and an occasional oxygen or two,\nusually a nitrogen somewhere, and all the remaining loose ends\nsatisfied with hydrogen atoms.\n\n\nAlmost every drug that is to be found in this book is nothing more\nthan a different arrangement of atoms of these four elements.\n\n\nThis compound, thiomescaline, is a byway that takes advantage of one\nof those vertical columns.  Directly below the element oxygen, there\nis found sulfur, which has much the same binding complexity, but is\ntwice as massive.  The prototype of all the phenethylamine drugs being\ndiscussed in this book is mescaline, a very simple compound containing\nthese basic four elements of life and pharmacology; it contains eleven\ncarbon atoms, three oxygen atoms, one nitrogen atom, and there are a\ntotal of seventeen hydrogen atoms required to balance the books.  One\nof the oxygen atoms holds a central position, and the other two are\nreflections of one another and cannot be distinguished chemically.\nThe structure of thiomescaline is generated by plucking out that\ncentral oxygen atom of mescaline, and putting a sulfur atom back in\nits place.  The definition of the term \"thio\" is quite simple--it\nmeans a sulfur-in-place-of-an-oxygen, with everything else left alone.\nIt is a little awe-inspiring to think that every oxy anything can have\na thio something as a spatially similar analogue.  And there are a lot\nof oxy things in the body and in the medicine cabinet.  A number of\nthem are discussed in this book.",

There\nis an art to the assignment of an exact number or, as is sometimes\ndesperately needed, a fuzzy number, to a collection of things.  In my\nyouth (somewhere way back yonder in the early part of the century) I\nhad been taught rules of grammer that were unquestionably expected of\nany well-educated person.  If you used a Latin stem, you used a Latin\nprefix.  And if you used a Greek stem, you used a Greek prefix.\nConsider a collection of things with simple geometric sides (a side is\na latus in Latin).  One would speak of a one-sided object as being\nunilateral, and a bilateral object has two sides.  A trilateral, and\nquadrilateral, and way up there to multilateral objects, are referred\nto as having three or four or a lot of sides, respectively.  Just the\nopposite occurs with geometric objects with faces.  A face is a hedra\nin Greek, so one really should use the Greek structure.  If one has\njust one face, one has a monohedron, a dihedron has two faces, and\nthere are trihedron, tetrahedron, and polyhedron for things that have\nthree, four, or a lot of faces.  Actually, the prefix \"poly\" swings\nboth ways.  It was initially a Greek term, but as was the fate of many\nGreek words, it wandered its way from East to West, and ended up as a\nLatin term as well.\n\n\nBut back to the problem of how to refer to something that is more than\none or two, but not as much as a lot?  If you know exactly how many,\nyou should use the proper prefix.  But what if you don't know how\nmany?  There are terms such as \"some.\" And there is \"several.\" There\nis a \"few\" and a \"number of\" and \"numerous\" and \"a hand full.\" One\ndesperately looks for a term that is a collective, but which carries\nthe meaning of an undefined number.  There are English gems such as a\npride of lions and a host of daffodils.  But without a specific animal\nor plant of reference, one must have a target collective that is\nappropriate, to let the term \"many\" or \"few\" imply the proper size.\nThere were many hundreds of persons (a few thousands of persons) at\nthe rally.  Several dozen hunters (a few score hunters) were gathered\nat the lake.  A wonderful prefix is \"oligo\" which means a few, not a\nlot, and it means that I am not sure just how many are meant.  Say,\nfor example, that you have synthesized something in a biochemical\nmixture that contains three or four peptides.  Di-and tri- and\ntetrapeptides are exact terms, but they do not describe what you have\ndone.  Polypeptide is way too big.  However, an oligopeptide means\nthat there are a few peptide units, I'm not sure how many.  This may\nwell be the most accurate description of just what you have.\n\n\nI love the British modesty that is shown by hiding a person's physical\nweight by referring to it with the dimension known as the stone.  This\nis, as I remember, something like 14 pounds.  So, if stones were the\nweight equivalent of 10 milligrams, the activity of TA would be\nseveral stone.  And since the synthetic intermediate\n1-allyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene is one of the ten essential oils,\nthe amination step from our hypothetical reaction in the human liver\nwould make TA one of the so-called Ten Essential Amphetamines.",

    description: "Here is the chemical that is central to\nthis entire book.  This is the structural point of departure for every\ncompound that is discussed here.  It is the RPS in PIHKAL.  It is\nwithout activity in man!  Certainly not for the lack of trying, as\nsome of the dosage trials that are tucked away in the literature (as\nabstracted in the \"Qualitative Comments\" given above) are pretty heavy\nduty.  Actually, I truly doubt that all of the experimenters used\nexactly that phrase, \"No effects,\" but it is patently obvious that no\neffects were found.  It happened to be the phrase I had used in my own\nnotes.\n\n\nThis, the simplest of all phenethylamines, has always been the darling\nof the psychopharmacologists in that it is structurally clean, it is\nnaturally present in various human fluids and tissues, and because of\nits close chemical relationship to amphetamine and to the\nneurotransmitters.  These facts continuously encourage theories that\ninvolve PEA in mental illness.  Its levels in urine may be decreased\nin people diagnosed as being depressed.  Its levels may be increased\nin people diagnosed as being paranoid schizophrenics.  Maybe it is\nalso increased in people under extreme stress.  The human trials were\ninitially an attempt to provoke some psychological change, and indeed\nsome clinicians have reported intense headaches generated in\ndepressives following PEA administration.  But then, others have seen\nnothing.  The studies evolved into searches for metabolic difference\nthat might be of some diagnostic value.  And even here, the jury is\nstill out.\n\n\nPhenethylamine is found throughout nature, in both plants and animals.\nIt is the end product of phenylalanine in the putrefaction of tissue.\nOne of its most popularized occurrences has been as a major component\nof chocolate, and it has hit the Sunday Supplements as the\nlove-sickness chemical.  Those falling out of love are compulsive\nchocolate eaters, trying to replenish and repair the body's loss of\nthis compound--or so the myth goes.  But this amine is voraciously\nmetabolized to the apparently inactive compound phenylacetic acid, and\nto some tyramine as well.  Both of these products are also normal\ncomponents in the body.  And, as a wry side-comment, phenylacetic acid\nis a major precursor in the illicit synthesis of amphetamine and\nmethamphetamine.\n\n\nPhenethylamine is intrinsically a stimulant, although it doesn't last\nlong enough to express this property.  In other words, it is rapidly\nand completely destroyed in the human body.  It is only when a number\nof substituent groups are placed here or there on the molecule that\nthis metabolic fate is avoided and pharmacological activity becomes\napparent.\n\n\n\tTo a large measure, this book has emphasized the \"phenyl\" end\nof the phenethylamine molecule, and the \"what,\" the \"where,\" and the\n\"how many\" of the substituent groups involved.  There is a broad\nvariety of chemical groups that can be attached to the benzene ring,\nat one or more of the five available positions, and in an unending\nnumber of combinations.  And, in any given molecule, the greater the\nnumber of substituents on the benzene ring, the greater the likelihood\nthat there will be psychedelic action rather that stimulant action.\n\n\n\tBut what can be said about the \"ethylamine\" end of the\nphenethylamine molecule?  This is the veritable backbone that holds\neverything together, and simple changes here can produce new\nprototypes that can serve as starting points for the substituent game\non the benzene ring.  Thus, just as there is a \"family\" of compounds\nbased on the foundation of phenethylamine itself, there is an equally\nvaried and rich \"families\" of other compounds that might be based on\nsome phenethylamine with a small modification to its backbone.\n\n\n\tSo, for the moment, leave the aromatic ring alone, and let us\nexplore simple changes in the ethylamine chain itself.  And the\nsimplest structural unit of change is a single carbon atom, called the\nmethyl group.  Where can it be placed?\n\n\nThe adding of a methyl group adjacent to the amine produces\nphenylisopropylamine, or amphetamine.  This has been exploited already\nas one of the richest families of psychedelic drugs; and over half of\nthe recipes in Book II are specifically for amphetamine analogues with\nvarious substituents on the aromatic ring.  The further methylation of\namphetamine with yet another methyl group, this time on the nitrogen\natom, yields methamphetamine.  Here the track record with various\nsubstituents on the aromatic ring is not nearly as good.  Many have\nbeen explored and, with one exception, the quality and potency of\nhuman activity is down.  But the one exception, the N-methyl analogue\nof MDA, proved to be the most remarkable MDMA.\n\n\nThe placement of the methyl group between the two carbons (so to\nspeak) produces a cyclopropyl system.  The simplest example is\n2-phenylcyclopropylamine, a drug with the generic name of\ntranylcypromine and the trade name Parnate.  It is a mono-amine\noxidase inhibitor and has been marketed as an antidepressant, but the\ncompound is also a mild stimulant causing insomnia, restlessness and\nphotophobia.  Substitutions on the benzene ring of this system have\nnot been too promising.  The DOM analogue,\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyltranylcypromine is active in man, and is\ndiscussed in its own recipe under DMCPA.  The inactive mescaline\nanalogue TMT is also mentioned there.\n\n\nThe dropping of one carbon from the phenethylamine chain gives a\nbenzyl amine, basically an inactive nucleus.  Two families deserve\nmention, however.  The phencylidine area, phenylcyclohexylpiperidine\nor PCP, is represented by a number of benzyl amines.  Ketamine is also\na benzyl amine.  These are all analgesics and anesthetics with central\nproperties far removed from the stimulant area, and are not really\npart of this book.  There is a benzyl amine that is a pure stimulant,\nwhich has been closely compared to amphetamine in its action This is\nbenzylpiperazine, a base that is active in the 20 to 100 milligram\nrange, but which has an acceptability similar to amphetamine.  If this\nis a valid stimulant, I think that much magic might be found in and\naround compounds such as (1) the MDMA analogue,\nN-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)piperazine (or its N-methyl-counterpart\nN-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)-N'-methylpiperazine) or (2) the DOM\nanalogue, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzylpiperazine.  The benzyl amine\nthat results by the relocation of the amine group of MDA from the\nbeta-carbon atom to the alpha-carbon atom is known, and is active.\nIt, and its N-methyl homologue, are described and discussed in the\ncommentary under MDA.  Dropping another carbon atom gives a yet\nshorter chain (no carbons at all!) and this is to be found in the\nphenylpiperazine analogue 3-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine.  I have\nbeen told that this base is an active hallucinogen as the\ndihydrobromide salt at 50 milligrams sublingually, or at 15 milligrams\nintravenously in man.  The corresponding 3-chloro analogue at 20 to 40\nmilligrams orally in man or at 8 milligrams intravenously, led to\npanic attacks in some 10% of the experimental subjects, but not to any\nobserved psychedelic or stimulant responses.\n\n\nWhat happens if you extend the chain to a third carbon?  The parent\nsystem is called the phenyl-(n)-propylamine, and the parent chain\nstructure, either as the primary amine or as its alpha-methyl\ncounterpart, represents compounds that are inactive as stimulants.\nThe DOM-analogues have been made and are, at least in the rabbit\nrectal hyperthermia assay, uninteresting.  A commercially available\nfine chemical known as piperonylacetone has been offered as either of\ntwo materials.  One, correctly called 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone\nor 3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl methyl ketone, gives rise upon reductive\namination to MDA (using ammonia) or MDMA (using methylamine).  This is\nan aromatic compound with a three-carbon side-chain and the\namine-nitrogen on the beta-carbon.  The other so-called\npiperonylacetone is really 3,4-methylenedioxybenzylacetone, an\naromatic compound with a four-carbon side-chain.  It produces, on\nreductive amination with ammonia or methylamine, the corresponding\nalpha-methyl-(n)-propylamines, with a four-carbon side-chain and the\namine-nitrogen on the gamma-carbon.  They are completely unexplored in\nman and so it is not known whether they are or are not psychedelic.\nAs possible mis-synthesized products, they may appear quite\nunintentionally and must be evaluated as totally new materials.  The\ngamma-amine analogue of MDA, a methylenedioxy substituted three carbon\nside-chain with the amine-nitrogen on the gamma carbon, has indeed\nbeen made and evaluated, and is discussed under MDA.  The extension of\nthe chain of mescaline to three atoms, by the inclusion of an oxygen\natom, has produced two compounds that have also been assayed.  They\nare mentioned in the recipe for mescaline.\n\n\nThe chain that reaches out to the amine group can be tied back in\nagain to the ring, with a second chain.  There are 2-aminobenzoindanes\nwhich are phenethylamines with a one-carbon link tying the\nalpha-position of the chain back to the aromatic ring.  And there are\n2-aminotetralines which are phenethylamines which have a two-carbon\nlink tying the alpha-position of the chain back to the aromatic ring.\nBoth unsubstituted ring systems are known and both are fair\nstimulants.  Both systems have been modified with the DOM substituent\npatterns (called DOM-AI and DOM-AT respectively), but neither of these\nhas been tried in man.  And the analogues with the MDA substitution\npattern are discussed elsewhere in this book.\n\n\nAnd there is one more obvious remaining methylation pattern.  What\nabout phenethylamine or amphetamine compounds with two methyl groups\non the nitrogen?  The parent amphetamine example,\nN,N-dimethylamphetamine, has received much notoriety lately in that it\nhas become a scheduled drug in the United States.  Ephedrine is a\nmajor precursor in the illicit synthesis of methamphetamine, and with\nthe increased law-enforcement attention being paid to this process,\nthere has been increasing promotion of the unrestricted homologue,\nN-methylephedrine, to the methamphetamine chemist.  This starting\nmaterial gives rise to N,N-dimethylamphetamine which is a material of\ndubious stimulant properties.  A number of N,N-dimethylamphetamine\nderivatives, with \"psychedelic\" ring substituents, have been explored\nas iodinated brain-flow indicators, and they are explicitly named\nwithin the appropriate recipes.  But none of them have shown any\npsychedelic action.\n\n\nThis is as good a place as any to discuss two or three simple\ncompounds, phenethylamines, with only one substituent on the benzene\nring.  The 2-carbon analog of 4-MA, is 4-methoxyphenethylamine, or\nMPEA.  This is a kissing cousin to DMPEA, of such fame in the search\nfor a urine factor that could be related to schizophrenia.  And the\nend results of the search for this compound in the urine of mentally\nill patients are as controversial as they were for DMPEA.  There has\nbeen no confirmed relationship to the diagnosis.  And efforts to see\nif it is centrally active were failures--at dosages of up to 400\nmilligrams in man, there was no activity.  The 4-chloro-analogue is\n4-chlorophenethylamine (4-Cl-PEA) and it has actually been pushed up\nto even higher levels (to 500 milligrams dosage, orally) and it is\nalso without activity.  A passing bit of charming trivia.  A\npositional isomer of MPEA is 3-methoxyphenethylamine (3-MPEA) and,\nalthough there are no reported human trials with this, it has been\ngraced with an Edgewood Arsenal code number, vis., EA-1302.",

    description: "There is not much there, so there is not\nmuch to make commentary on.  This response is called a \"threshhold\"\neffect, and cannot be used to predict with any confidence just what\nlevel (if any) would produce psychological effects.\n\n\nA similar chain on the 4-position, but with one less carbon atom,\ndeserves special comment.  Rather than a phenethyloxy group, this\nwould be benzyloxy group (which in this day and age of Chemical\nAbstracts purity should probably be called a phenylmethoxy group).  If\none were to follow the naming philosophy of Rproscaline equals P and\nbuscaline equals BS convention, one would call it 4-benzescaline, and\ngive it the code name BZ.  The nomenclature purist would probably call\nthe compound PM (for phenylmescaline or, more likely\nphenylmethoxydimethoxyphenethylamine), since the term BZ is awkward\nand misleading.  It is a code name that has been given to a potent CNS\nagent known as quinuclidin-3-yl benzilate, which is a chemical and\nbiological warfare (CBW) incapacitating agent currently being stored\nby the military to the extent of 20,000 pounds.  And, BZ has also\nrecently become the jargon name given to benzodiazepine receptors.\nThey have been called the BZ-receptors.\n\n\nHowever, let's be awkward and misleading, and call this benzyloxy-base\nBZ.  For one thing, the three-carbon analogue 3C-BZ has already been\ndescribed in its own recipe using this code.  And the 4-fluoroanalogue\nof it, 3C-FBZ, is also mentioned there.  And BZ has already been\ndescribed synthetically, having been made in exactly the procedure\ngiven for escaline, except that the reduction of the nitrile was not\ndone by catalytic hydrogenation but rather by sodium borohydride in\nthe presence of cobalt chloride.  It has been shown to be a effective\nserotonin agonist, and may warrant human experimentation.  The\nserotonin activity suggests that it might be active at the same levels\nfound for proscaline.\n\n\nAll of this says very little about PE.  But then, there is very little\nto say about PE except that it may be active at very high levels, and\nI am not sure just how to get there safely.",

    description: "The 4-propoxy homologue of TMA-2 and MEM is\nclearly less active, and this has discouraged me from putting too much\nmore effort in this direction.  Three additional materials of this\npattern were prepared and either shown to be even less active, or\nsimply were not assayed at all.  These are the 4-isopropoxy isomer\n(MIPM), the (n)-butoxy homologue (MBM), and the (n)-amyl homologue\n(MAM).  They scarcely warrant separate recipes as they were all made\nin a manner similar to this one describing MPM.\n\n\nFor the preparation of MIPM, the above phenol, 2,5-dimethoxyphenol was\nisopropylated with isopropyl bromide in methanolic KOH giving\n2,5-dimethoxy-1-(i)-propoxybenzene as an oil.  This formed the\nbenzaldehyde with the standard Vilsmeier conditions, which melted at\n77-78 °C from hexane and which gave a yellow malononitrile derivative\nmelting at 171.5-173 °C.  The nitrostyrene, from nitroethane in acetic\nacid was orange colored and melted at 100-101 °C from either methanol\nor hexane.  This was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in ether to\ngive 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(i)-propoxyamphetamine hydrochloride (MIPM).  The\nproperties of the isolated salt were strange (soluble in acetone but\nnot in water) and the microanalysis was low in the carbon value.  The\nmolecular structure had a pleasant appeal to it, with a complete\nreflection symmetry shown by the atoms of the amphetamine side chain\nand the isopropoxy side chain.  But the nature of the actual product\nin hand had no appeal at all, and no assay was ever started.\n\n\nFor the preparation of MBM, the starting phenol was alkylated to\n2-(n)-butoxy-1,4-dimethoxybenzene in methanolic KOH with n-butyl\nbromide.  The benzaldehyde melted at 79.5-81 °C from methanol, and\nformed a malononitrile derivative that had a melting point of\n134.5-135 C.  The nitrostyrene from the aldehyde and nitroethane in\nacetic acid crystallized from methanol with a mp of 71-72 °C.  Lithium\naluminum hydride reduction in ether gave the ether-insoluble\nchloroform-soluble product 4-(n)-butoxy-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine\nhydrochloride (MBM) with a melting point of 128-130 °C.  This product\nmet all tests for structural integrity, and assays were started.  At\nlevels of up to 12.0 milligrams, there were no effects noted.\n\n\nAs to the preparation of MAM, the exact same sequence was used, except\nfor the employment of n-amyl bromide.  The benzaldehyde crystallized\nfrom methanol with a mp of 79-80 °C, and formed a malononitrile\nderivative which was bright yellow and melted at 103-104 °C.  The\nnitrostyrene, when pure, melted at 57-58.5 °C but proved very\ndifficult to separate from the aldehyde.  The final product,\n4-(n)-amyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine hydrochloride (MAM) was obtained\nby lithium aluminum hydride reduction in ether and melted at 125-127\n°C.  It was assayed at up to 16 milligrams, at which level there was\nnoted a heaviness in the chest and head at the 2-hour point, but no\ncardiovascular disturbance and no mydriasis.  This was called an\ninactive level, and no higher one has yet been tried.",

    description: "This is one of the very few compounds with\nwhich I actually risked (and took) the lives of experimental animals.\nI was still impressed by the scientific myth that pharmacological\nresearch wasn't really acceptable without animal support data.  And I\nhad access to an experimental mouse colony at the University.  I\ninjected one mouse with a dose of 300 mg/Kg., i.p.  That sounds pretty\nscientific.  But what it really means is that I picked up a mouse by\nthe scruff of the back with my left hand, then turned my hand over so\nthat the mouse was belly-up.  I put the ring finger over a hind leg to\nkeep things relatively immobile.  Usually at this point there is a\nlittle urine evident where there had been none before.  And I took a\nsyringe equipped with a very fine needle and containing about 8\nmilligrams of MME in a fraction of a mL of a water solution and pushed\nthat needle into the mouse at about where the navel would be if one\ncould see the mouse's navel, and then I pulled the needle back just a\nlittle so that there should be nothing at the business end but the\nloose folds of the peritoneum.  Then I pushed the syringe plunger\nhome, effectively squirting the water solution into the area that\nsurrounds the intestines.  I dropped the mouse back into his cage, and\nwatched.  In this case, the mouse went into a twitching series of\nconvulsions (known as clonic in the trade) and in five minutes he was\ndead.\n\n\nFired with the lust for killing, I grabbed another mouse, and nailed\nhim with 175 mg/Kg.  Dead in 6 minutes.  Another one at 107 mg/Kg.\nDead in 5 minutes.  Another at 75 mg/Kg.  Well, he looked pretty sick\nthere for a while, and had some shakes, and then he seemed to be\npretty much OK.  One final orgy of murder.  I injected 5 mice at 100\nmg/Kg i.p., and watched four of them die within 20 minutes.  I took in\nmy hands the sole survivor, and I went outside the laboratory and let\nhim loose on the hillside.  He scampered away and I never saw him\nagain.\n\n\nAnd what did I learn, at the cost of seven precious lives which I can\nnever replace?  Not a damned thing.  Maybe there is an LD-50 somewhere\naround 60 or 80 mg/Kg.  This is for mice, not for men.  I was\nintending to take an initial trial dose of 300 micrograms of this\ncompletely untested compound, and it would have made no difference to\nme if the LD-50 had been 600 mg/Kg or 6 mg/Kg.  I still took my trial\ndose, and had absolutely no effects, and I never killed another mouse\nagain.  No, that is simply out-and-out dishonest.  I had an invasion\nof field mice last winter coming up through a hole in the floor behind\nthe garbage holder under the kitchen sink, and I blocked the hole, but\nI also set some mouse traps.  And I caught a couple.  But never again\nfor the simple and stupid reasons of being able to say that \"This\ncompound has an LD-50 in the mouse of 70 mg/Kg.\" Who cares?  Why kill?\n\n\nBut there are two very valuable things that have come out of this\nsimple study with MME.  One is, of course, that it is an active\ncompound and as such warrants additional attention.  And the other,\nand even more important, is that as one of the three possible ethoxy\nhomologues of TMA-2, it is less active than MEM.  The third possible\nethoxy compound is EMM and, as will be found elsewhere in this book,\nit is even less active.  Thus it is MEM, only, that maintains the\npotency of TMA-2, and this was the initial observation that really\nfocused my attention on the importance of the 4-position.",

There can be little argument that the 3b\nis less effective than the 3a, but no one can say by how much.  The\nliterature statement is that it is threefold less, but that was based\non the relative responses at just-above-threshold levels.  The effects\nhere are hand-wavingly similar to those reported for MMDA-3a at 20\nmilligrams, but these are difficult to compare accurately as they were\nreported by different people.

    description: "The term MMDA-3a has the feel of being\ncomplicated, but there is a reason for the code.  As had been\nmentioned, MMDA was the initials for methoxy (the M) methylenedioxy\n(the MD) amphetamine (the A).  And with a molecule of amphetamine\nthere are six ways of sticking these two groupings on the aromatic\nring.  The numbers 1-6 had already been assigned to the six ways of\nsticking three methoxyl groups onto an amphetamine molecule (with the\ntrimethoxyamphetamines, the TMA's) and I decided to hew to the same\nconvention with the methylenedioxy counterparts.  However, there are\ntwo #3's (the methoxy and the methylenedioxy can go onto the three\noxygen atoms in a row in two different ways, whereas the three\nmethoxys can go on in just one way) and there can be no #6 (since a\nmethylenedioxy must, perforce, have two oxygens that are adjacent, and\nthere are none to be so found in the 2,4,6-orientation of TMA-6).  So,\nwith two possible MMDA-3's it becomes reasonable, in fact essential,\nto name one of them \"a\" and the other \"b\".  The \"a\" orientation occurs\nin nature as the essential oil croweacin, or\n1-allyl-2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene.  It thus can allow\nMMDA-3a to be classified as an Essential Amphetamine, since it can\narise, in principle, by amination in the liver in vivo.  But in the\nlaboratory, croweacin is certainly not a practical starting material\nin this synthesis.\n\n\nI have been told of a number of clinical trials that have explored\nMMDA-3a at considerably higher levels, but I have no explicit\nquotations to give, and the details are quite sketchy.  Three trials\nat 80 milligrams, and one at 100 milligrams, all made comparisons, in\nboth quantity and quality of the experience, to 100 micrograms of LSD.\nHowever, two events occurred that may or may not be related to these\ntrials; one subject had a spontaneous peak experience five days after\nthe experiment, and another made a symbolic suicide attempt.\n\n\nAnd, as with MMDA-2, both the 2-carbon \"phenethylamine\" analogue and\nthe 4-carbon RARIADNES analogue of MMDA-3a have been made.  The\nphenethylamine analog was prepared by the condensation of 7.6 g of the\nabove benzaldehyde with nitromethane (in acetic acid with ammonium\nacetate catalyst, giving 5.4 g of the nitrostyrene with a mp of\n115.5-116.5 °C from methanol) followed by lithium aluminum hydride\nreduction (in ether).  The product,\n2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-3a)\nmelted at 143-145 °C.  A series of subjective evaluations were made,\nand there are reports of marginal effects in the 40 to 120 milligram\nrange.

An\nawareness of the chemical structure immediately shows, of course, the\nclose resemblance.  There is the complete MDA molecule, with the\naddition of a methoxy group.  And for the non-chemist, the name itself\n(MMDA-2) represents the second possible methoxy-MDA.  Certainly one\nproperty that is shared with MDA is the broad variety of opinions as\nto the quality of its action.  Some like it much, and some like it not\nat all.  The N-methyl homologue was indeed made, for direct evaluation\nin comparison to N-methyl MDA (which is MDMA).\n\n\nThe phenethylamine analog of MMDA-2 has been prepared by the\ncondensation of the above benzaldehyde with nitromethane (in acetic\nacid with ammonium acetate catalyst, giving an equal weight of the\nnitrostyrene as deep orange crystals with a mp of 166-167 °C from\nethyl acetate) followed by lithium aluminum hydride reduction (in\nether).  The product, 2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenethylamine\nhydrochloride (2C-2) melted at 218-219 °C.  There were no effects\nobserved at up to 2.6 milligrams, but no higher trials were made.  The\n4-carbon homologue was made similarly (from the aldehyde and\nnitropropane but using tert-butylammonium acetate as a reagent in 100%\nexcess and isopropanol as solvent, giving orange crystals melting at\n98-99 °C from methanol) followed by reduction (with lithium aluminum\nhydride in ether) to give\n1-(2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane hydrochloride\n(4C-2) with a mp of 172-174 °C.  This material has never even been\ntasted.\n\n\nThe Tweetio homologue of MMDA-2 has been tasted, however.  This is\n2-ethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine, or EMDA-2.  The allyl ether of\nsesamol (3,4-methylenedioxy-allyloxybenzene) was rearranged to the\n2-allyl phenol which was, in turn, converted to the ethyl ether.\nReaction with tetranitromethane gave the nitrostyrene intermediate\nwhich had a mp of 120-121 °C.  The final hydrochloride salt of EMDA-2\nhad a mp of 188-188.5 °C.  At 135 milligrams, there have been reported\neyes-closed visual phenomena, with intense colors.  The overall\nduration is similar to MMDA-2 (some 10 hours) and there are reported\nsleep disturbances.  At 185 milligrams, the feelings were intensified,\nthere were \"marvelous eyes-closed visuals (the colors were\nincredible), good concentration, but distinct body-tingles and\nrushes.\" The time span was about 12 hours from start to finish, but it\nproved to be impossible to sleep afterwards.  This homologue is thus\nabout a third the potency of MMDA-2.",

This is the compound that I had first completed\nin 1962, and had named it MMDA, and had begun the exploring of it when\nI heard that Dr. Gordon A. Alles, a professor of pharmacology at U. C.\nL. A. who had his own private laboratory in Los Angeles, had also\nsynthesized it in 1962, had also named it MMDA, and had also begun\nexploring it.

The major essential oil from that spice is\nmyristicin, and it is the easiest source of MMDA.  It has been\nreported that the passage of this oil through the liver of a rabbit\nwill generate MMDA in that animal.  The only difference between the\ntwo molecules, structurally, are the elements of ammonia.  Myristicin\nplus ammonia gives MMDA.  Another natural source of myristicin is Oil\nof Parsley, which is also an excellent source of apiole, mentioned\nunder DMMDA.  A rumor that had currency in the 1960's, that parsley\ncould get you high, probably had its origins in the reports of\nmyristicin being present, coupled with myristicin being the principal\nsource of MMDA.  The relationship to myristicin (an essential oil) led\nto the classifying of MMDA as a Essential Amphetamine.  These\nrelationships are expanded upon, under TMA.\n\n\nAt the time that the FDA issued its proclamation of dangerous drugs\n(in the mid-1960's), MMDA was being talked about, and in fact it had\njust become available commercially in England through the Koch Light\nIndustries.  But to my knowledge it had never appeared on the street,\nso its having being swept into the listings of evil drugs was simply a\ncoincidence of bad timing.  The close resemblance of initials between\nMMDA, and the currently notorious MDMA, has led to no small amount of\nconfusion in the popular press.

The track record from the comparison of active\ncompounds that are primary amines, and their N-methyl homologues, has\nshown that, in general, the stimulant component might be maintained,\nbut the \"psychedelic\" contribution is generally much reduced.  MDMA\nis, of course, an exception, but then, that particular compound is a\none-of-a-kind thing which simply defies all the rules anyway, and I\ndrop it from this kind of reasoning.  And as 4-MA is a pretty pushy\nstimulant with little if any sensory sparkle, why bother with the\nN-methyl compound at all?\n\n\nFor a completely silly and romantic reason.  When the MDMA story\nbecame front-page news back in mid-1985, the cartoonist-author of\nDoonesbury, Gary Trudeau, did a two-week feature on it, playing it\nhumorous, and almost (but not quite) straight, in a hilarious sequence\nof twelve strips.  On August 19, 1985 he had Duke, president of Baby\nDoc College, introduce the drug design team from USC in the form of\ntwo brilliant twins, Drs. Albie and Bunny Gorp.  They vividly\ndemonstrated to the enthusiastic conference that their new drug\n\"Intensity\" was simply MDMA with one of the two oxygens removed.\n\"Voila,\" said one of them, with a molecular model in his hands, \"Legal\nas sea salt.\" And what is MDMA with one oxygen atom removed?  It is\n4-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine or METHYL-MA which, according to the\ntwins, should give the illusion of substance to one's alter ego.  So,\nI called it Doonesamine, or simply RDOONES for short.  Maybe that was\nalso a homonym for Frank Herbert's science fiction book, \"Dune,\"\nwherein the magical drug \"spice\" provided a most remarkable alteration\nof the user's state of consciousness.\n\n\nThis comic strip presentation was the first nationally distributed\nallusion to the term \"designer drugs,\" and perhaps it lent unexpected\nsupport for the passage, just a year later, of the Controlled\nSubstances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986.  This intentionally vague\npiece of legislation makes the giving of, or the taking of, or even\nthe possession with the intent to take, any drug that in any way\nalters your state of consciousness, a felony.  A shameful and\ndesperate effort by the governmental authorities to maintain the image\nof control in a lost situation.\n\n\nEnough editorial.  Back to historic technicalities.  In truth,\nMETHYL-MA is a well studied drug, at least in animals.  In both mice\nand rats, it is an exceptionally potent agent in creating the state of\ncatatonia.  Animal studies, prompted by the clandestine synthesis of\nMETHYL-MA, have shown that there is indeed locomotor stimulation and\nsome central effects, but these effects are somehow different than\nthose of a simple amphetamine-like agent.  The experimenter's\nconclusions, based on its structural resemblance to 4-MA and its\nproclivity to produce catatonia in some animal species and the\never-present possibility that there might be unsuspected neurochemical\nchanges to be seen with its use, are that human experimentation should\nbe discouraged.  I have come to the same conclusion, but in my case\nthis is based on a much more succinct observation: I tried it and I\ndidn't like it.\n\n\nA brief comment on two of the N,N-dimethylhomologues of\nmethoxyamphetamine.  One was 4-methoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine,\n4-MNNA.  This material, made by the reductive amination of\n4-methoxyphenylacetone with dimethylamine, was a colorless oil, which\ndistilled at 70-85 °C at 0.3 mm/Hg.  The corresponding\n2-methoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine was similarly made.  2-MNNA was also\na colorless oil and had the same bp.  Both of them were fluorinated\nwith 18F labelled acetyl hypofluorite (3% and 6% yields respectively)\nbut neither of them was pursued any further in the search for a brain\nblood flow indicator.",

The dosage range\nexplored is remarkably tight, attesting to a consistency of response.\nThe typical supplement used, if any, was 70 milligrams or less, just\nbefore the two hour point.  This indicates a chronology similar to\nthat of MDMA, and about two thirds the potency.\n\n\nThe arguments that weigh the use of the code name of MBDB against the\nuse of METHYL-J are present in the recipe for BDB (or J).  But what is\nthe source of this H, I, J, K naming thing that I have called the Muni\nMetro?\n\n\nFirst, a little bit of local color.  In San Francisco, there is a\npublic transportation called the S.F. Municipal Metropolitan System\ncomplex that has integrated an underground street-car system that\nemerges above ground and connects with a bus network.  A number of the\nstreet-car lines fan across the city to the outer reaches which are\ncalled the Avenues.  These lines are named by sequential letters.\nThere is the J Church Street line, the K Ingelside line, the L Taraval\nline, the M Ocean line, and the N Judah.  And in the pharmacological\ncomplex that involved the lengthening of the aliphatic chain, there\nwere two coincidental benchmarks in the names that were proposed.\nThose without an alpha-substituent (no carbon atoms at the position\nalpha to the amine group, the phenethylamines) were originally called\nthe H compounds.  H stood for \"homopiperonylamine.\" And the first of\nthose with the alpha-ethyl group there (two carbon atoms at the\nposition alpha to the amine group) was familiarly called \"Jacobamine\"\nin recognition of a famous chemist who had set the synthetic wheels in\nmotion.\n\n\nIt is quite obvious, that with one carbon atom lying on that\nalpha-position, you are precisely half-way between no carbons and two\ncarbons.  And there was one letter of the alphabet that lies precisely\nhalf-way between an H and a J.  So, an natural naming pattern\ndeveloped.  The I compounds were already pretty well known by names\nsuch as MDA and MDMA and MDE, so I, and METHYL-I, and ETHYL-I, didn't\nhave any appeal.  But for the new, the alpha-ethyl compounds, why not\ncall them the J-compounds?  If it has a methyl on the nitrogen it will\nbe METHYL-J and if it has an ethyl group it will be ETHYL-J.

    description: "The mention above, of the 10 milligrams of\nMETHYL-DOB followed by 5 milligrams of psilocybin, leads to some\ninteresting speculation.  The usual pattern that is seen when two\npsychedelic drugs are taken too closely together is that the second\nexperience is less effective than would have been expected.  This is\nthe property that is called tolerance, and it is frequently seen in\npharmacology.  The two exposures may be to a single drug, or they may\nbe to two different drugs which usually have some properties in\ncommon.  It is as if the spirit of the receptor site had become a\nlittle tired and needed a while to rest up and recuperate.  When there\nis a demand for a repeat of full effectiveness, the user will\ncustomarily increase the dosage of the drug that is used.  It is one\nof the built-in protections, in the area of psychedelics that, after\none experience, you must wait for a period of time to lose the\nrefractoriness that has set in.\n\n\nThe measure of the degree of tolerance that can be shared between\ndifferent drugs, called cross-tolerance, can be used as an estimate of\nthe similarities of their mechanisms of action.  In other words, if A\nand B are somehow seen by the body as being similar, then a normally\neffective dose of A will make a next-day's normally effective dose of\nB weaker than expected.  Or not active at all.  And B will do the same\njob on A.  If two drugs are different in their ways of doing things in\nthe body, there is most often no cross-tolerance seen.  This was\ndescribed for MDMA and MDA, and is the basis of the argument that they\nact by distinctly separate mechanisms.  A person who used what would\nbe held as an active dose of MDMA for several days lost all response\nto the drug.  He was tolerant to its effects.  But an exposure to an\neffective dose of MDA at the time that tolerance to MDMA was complete,\nprovided a normal response to the MDA.  The drugs are not\ncross-tolerant and the body recognizes them as distinct individuals.\n\n\nBut for one drug to promote, or to exaggerate, the effect of another\nis called potentiation, and can be a clue to the dynamics going on in\nthe brain or body.  Here, admittedly in only a single report,\nMETHYL-DOB had somehow sensitized the subject to a rather light dosage\nof psilocybin.  But there have been other reports like this that I\nhave heard of, from here and there.  I have been told of an experiment\nwith the dextro-isomer of DOM (this is the inactive optical isomer) at\na level that was, not surprisingly, without any effects.  The\nresearcher had a severe reaction the following day with what was\nreferred to as \"poor\" hashish.  A similar form of potentiation has\nbeen commented upon under the recipe for TOMSO, where an inactive\ndrug, and a most modest amount of alcohol, add together to create an\nunexpectedly intense intoxication.  But note that in each of these\ncases, it is a phenethylamine interacting with a non-phenethylamine\n(psilocybin is an indole, hashish is a non-alkaloid terpene thing, and\nalcohol is, well, alcohol).\n\n\nThe bottom line with METHYL-DOB is, as with the other N-methylated\npsychedelics, that it is way down in potency, and probably not worth\npursuing.",

One person told me that he had\nfelt nothing at up to 60 milligrams.  Another had found a threshold at\n50 milligrams, and had complete and thorough experiences at both 150\nand 200 milligrams.  Yet another person described two incidents\ninvolving separate individuals, with intravenous administrations of\n0.2 mg/Kg, which would be maybe 15 or 20 milligrams.  Both claimed a\nreal awareness in a matter of minutes, one with a tingling in the\ngenitalia and the other with a strange presence in the spine.  Both\nsubjects reported increases in body temperature and in blood pressure.\nApparently the effects were felt to persist for many hours.\n\n\nThere is an interesting, and potentially informative, convergence of\nthe metabolite of one drug with the structure of another.  Under 4-MA,\nmention was made of a bronchodilator that has been widely used in the\ntreatment of asthma and other allergenic conditions.  This compound,\n2-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine is known by the generic name of\nmethoxyphenamine, and a variety of trade names with Orthoxine (Upjohn)\nbeing the best known.  The typical dosage of methoxyphenamine is\nperhaps 100 milligrams, and it may be used several times a day.  It\napparently produces no changes in blood pressure and only a slight\ncardiac stimulation.  And one of the major metabolites of it in man is\nthe analogue with a hydroxyl group at the 5-position of the molecule.\nThis phenolic amine, 5-hydroxy-2-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine is just a\nmethyl group away from METHYL-DMA; it could either be methylated to\ncomplete the synthesis, or METHYL-DMA could be demethylated to form\nthis phenol.  There is plentiful precedent for both of these reactions\noccuring in the body.  It is always intriguing when drugs which show\ndistinctly different actions can, in principle, intersect\nmetabolically at a single structure.  One wonders just what the\npharmacology of that common intermediate might be.\n\n\nThree additional N-methylated homologues of known psychedelics warrant\nmention, but do not really deserve separate recipes.  This is because\nthey have had only the most cursory assaying, which I have learned\nabout by personal correspondence.  All three were synthesized by the\nreduction of the formamide of the parent primary amine with LAH.\nMETHYL-TMA (or N-methyl-3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine) had been run up\nin several trials to a maximum of 240 milligrams, with some mental\ndisturbances mentioned only at this highest level.  METHYL-TMA-2 (or\nN-methyl-2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine) had been tried at up to 120\nmilligrams without any effects.  METHYL-TMA-6 (or N-methyl-2,4,6-\ntrimethoxyamphetamine) had been tried at up to 30 milligrams and it,\ntoo, was apparently without effects.  These are reports that I have\nheard from others, but I have had no personal experience with them.\nThose that I can describe from personal experience are entered\nseparately as recipes of their own.  And there are many, many other\nN-methyl homologues which have been prepared and characterized in the\nliterature, and have yet to be tasted.  So far, however, the only\nconsistent thing seen is that, with N-methylation, the potency of the\npsychedelics is decreased, but the potency of the stimulants appears\nto be pretty much maintained.",

Both the quality of the experience and the potency of the\ncompound have been modified in more recent publications by the\noriginators of this compound.  A 40 milligram dose, after an induction\nperiod of an hour, produced a vague uneasiness that was interpreted\noriginally as a threshold psychedelic effect.  At doses in the 60 to\n90 milligram range, there were produced feelings of anxiety and\nparanoid fantasies, and distinct toxic signs such as flushing,\npalpitations, and occasional nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Any\npsychedelic effects seem to have been blurred by the more obvious\ntoxic actions of the drug.  I have been told that their final\nconclusion was that the drug appears toxic in the 50 to 60 milligram\nrange.  I have not personally explored this positional isomer of DOB.\n\n\nThe positional isomer of DOB with the bromine in the ortho-position is\n4,5-dimethoxy-2-bromoamphetamine and is called, not surprisingly,\nORTHO-DOB.

The\nbromination of 2,5-DMA is, of course, the preferred procedure for the\nsynthesis of 4-Br-2,5- DMA, or DOB, q.v.  None of these positional\nisomers has evear been put into man, but 3-Br-2,6-DMA and the\niodo-counterpart have been explored as potential radio-fluorine\ncarriers into the brain.

I got a call out of\nabsolutely nowhere, from a Stanislov Wistupkin, that he had discovered\na number of new psychedelic drugs which he would like to share with\nme.  Two of them were simple phenethylamines, one with an ethoxy group\nat the 4-position, and one with an allyloxy group there.  Both, he\nsaid, were mood elevators active between 100 and 300 milligrams.  One\nof them was this material, here called MEPEA, and the other one was\n3-methoxy-4-allyloxyphenethylamine, or MAPEA.  When I did meet him in\nperson, he gave me a most remarkable publication which had been\nauthored some ten years earlier, by a person named Leminger, now dead.\nIt was all in Czech, but quite unmistakably, right there on the third\npage, were the structures of MEPEA and MAPEA, and the statement that\nthey were active at between 100 and 300 milligrams.  I have not yet\nmade the allyloxy compound, but I feel that it too might be a gentle\nmood elevator similar to the ethoxy.\n\n\nA most appealing extension of these materials would be the amphetamine\nderivatives, things with a 3-methoxy group, and something small and\nterse on the 4-position.  The immediate analogies of MEPEA and MAPEA\nwould be 3-methoxy-4-ethoxy- (and 3-methoxy-4-allyloxy)-amphetamine.\nAnd equally interesting would be the 4-hydroxy analogue.  This would\nbe an easily made compound from vanillin, one of our most enjoyable\nspices in the kitchen cabinet, and it would be directly related to the\nessential oils, eugenol and isoeugenol.  This amphetamine compound has\nalready been synthesized, but it is still unexplored in man.\n\n\nSome years ago a report appeared in the forensic literature of Italy,\nof the seizure of a small semitransparent capsule containing 141\nmilligrams of a white powder that was stated to be a new\nhallucinogenic drug.  This was shown to contain an analogue of DOM,\n3-methoxy-4-methylamphetamine, or MMA.  The Italian authorities made\nno mention of the net weight contained in each dosage unit, but it has\nbeen found that the active level of MMA in man is in the area of 40-60\nmilligrams.  The compound can apparently be quite dysphoric, and long\nlived.\n\n\nIn the Czechoslovakian publication that presented MEPEA and MAPEA.\nthere were descriptions of escaline (E), proscaline (P), and the\nallyloxy analogue (AL).  These are all active in man, and have been\nentered elsewhere.  This is the only published material dealing with\npsychedelic drugs I have ever been able to find, from the laboratory\nof Otakar Leminger.  What sort of man was this chemist?  He worked for\nyears in industry, and only at the time of his retirement did he\npublish this little gem.  He lived at Usti, directly north of Praha,\non the Labe river (which is called by the better known name, the Elbe,\nas soon as it enters Germany).  Might there be other treasures that he\nhad discovered, and never published?  Was young Wistupkin a student of\nhis?  Are there unrecognized notes of Otakar Leminger sitting in some\nfarm house attic in Northern Czechoslovakia?  I extend my heartfelt\nsalute to an almost unknown explorer in the psychedelic drug area.",

    description: "MEM was both a valuable and dramatic\ncompound, as well as a drug that played a watershed role.  The\ncompletion of all the possible trimethoxyamphetamines (the TMA's)\nshowed that only two of them combined the values of dependability of\npositive psychedelic effects with a reasonably high potency.  Both\nTMA-2 and TMA-6 are treasures, both active in similar dosages, and\nboth offer methoxyl groups that are begging to be replaced by other\nthings.  The first focus was on TMA-2, partly because the needed\nsynthetic chemistry was better known, and partly because I had\ndiscovered its activity earlier.  But there were three entirely\ndifferent and distinct methoxyl groups to work on, in TMA-2.  There is\none at the 2-position, one at the 4-position, and one at the\n5-position.  The most obvious thing to do, it seemed, was to make each\nof them one carbon longer.  Replace a methoxy with an ethoxy.  And a\nlogical naming pattern could follow the use of M for methoxy, and E\nfor ethoxy, in sequence right around the ring from the 2- to the 4- to\nthe 5-positions.  The first group to be compared, then, would be EMM,\nMEM, and MME.  And of these three, it was only MEM that was right up\nthere in drama and in potency.  But, by the time that became apparent,\nI had already completed the diethoxy possibilities (EEM, EME, and MEE)\nas well as the triethoxy homologue, EEE.  With the discovery that the\n4-position was the magic leverage point, and that the homologues at\npositions 2- and 5- were clearly less interesting, all emphasis was\ndirected at this target, and this has led to the many 4-substituted\nfamilies that are now known to be highly potent and felt by many to be\npersonally valuable.\n\n\nWhy put such emphasis on potency, I am frequently asked? Why should it\nmatter how much of a compound you take, as long as the effective level\nis much lower than its toxic level?  Well, in a sense, that is the\nvery reason.  There are no guides as to what the toxic levels of any\nof these many compounds might really be in man.  There is simply no\nway of determining this.  Only a few have been explored in animals in\nthe pursuit of an LD-50 level.  Most of them are similar to\none-another, in that they are, in mice, of relatively low toxicity\nand, in rat, of relatively high toxicity.  But this toxicity appears\nnot to be related to potency in man.  So, if one might extrapolate\nthat they are of more or less the same risk to man (from the toxic\npoint of view) then the lower the dosage, the greater the safety.\nMaybe.  In the absence of anything factual, it makes a reasonable\noperating hypothesis.\n\n\nMany of the reports of MEM effects have been with experiments in which\nan effective dose of MDMA had been taken shortly earlier.  There has\ndeveloped a concept, embraced by a number of researchers, that the\nease and quietness usually seen with the development of the MDMA\nexperience can mitigate some of the physically disturbing symptoms\nsometimes seen with other psychedelics.  This may be partly due to a\nfamiliar entry into a altered place, and partly due to a lessening of\ndosage usually required for full effects.  MEM seems to have had more\ntrials using this combination than many of the other psychedelic\ndrugs.",

A number of progressive trials, up to a dosage of 4.6\nmilligrams, were without any central effects at all.\n\n\nThere is an instinct in structure-activity studies to think of a\nchange as a success or a failure, depending on whether there is an\nincrease or a decrease in the desired activity.  But if one were to\nlook at the effects of putting an ethoxy group onto TMA-2 in place of\na methoxy group as a way of decreasing the effectiveness, then the\n4-position becomes the worst position (MEM is equipotent to TMA-2),\nand the 5-position is perhaps a little less bad (MME is almost as\npotent) and the 2-position is the best by far (EMM is out of it,\npotency-wise).  In other words, in the comparison of the 2- and the\n5-positions, the lengthening of the 5-position gives modest loss of\nactivity, and the lengthening of the whatever in the 2-position is the\nmost disruptive.  With this as a basis for prediction, then MEE (which\ndiffers from MEM only by a lengthening of the 5-position substituent)\nmight be only a little less active than MEM and, as MEM is about the\nsame as TMA-2, it is distinctly possible that MEE may show activity in\nthe area at dosages that are not much above the 25 to 50 milligram\narea.

Having found the activity of MMDA, the\n\"scientific\" thing to do would be to compare it against the other\n\"psychotomimetic\" amphetamine that was known at that time (this was\n1962), namely TMA.  Comparing their structures, the only difference of\nany kind was that two of the adjacent methoxyl groups of TMA were\nreplaced with a 5-membered ring, called the methylenedioxy ring.\n\n\nWhere does one go next?  Some perverse inspiration suggested\nincreasing the size of this ring to a 6-membered ring, the\nethylenedioxy (or dioxene) homologue.  Well, if you thought that\ngetting myristicinaldehyde was a difficulty, it was nothing compared\nto getting this 6-membered counterpart.  But I huffed and I puffed,\nand I did make enough to taste and to evaluate.  And it was here that\nI got the divine message!  No activity!!  So, rather than being\ncondemned forever a la Sisyphus to push ever larger rings up my\npsyche, I gave myself permission to pursue another path.  The message\nwas: \"Don't change the groups.  Leave them as they are, but relocate\nthem instead.\" And that led directly to TMA-2 and its story.\n\n\nA couple of diversions may be mentioned here.  Before the blessed\ninactivity of MEDA was established, the 7-membered ring counterpart,\n3-methoxy-4,5-trimethylenedioxyamphetamine (MTMA) was prepared by\nessentially the same procedure.  The above\n3-methoxy-4,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde with trimethylene bromide gave\n3-methoxy-4,5-trimethylenedioxybenzaldehyde, white solids, with a\nmalononitrile derivative with a mp of 134-135 °C; the aldehyde with\nnitroethane gave the nitropropene with a mp of 86-87 °C; and this with\nLAH gave MTDA as the hydrochloride (mp 160-161 °C) again isolated\nfirst as the picrate.  It had been tasted at up to an 8 milligram\ndosage (no activity, but none expected) before being abandoned.  And,\nan initial effort was made to synthesize a five-member ring\n(methylenedioxy) with a methyl sticking out from it.  This ethylidine\nhomologue got as far as the aldehyde stage.  The reaction between\n3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde and 1,1-dibromoethane in acetone\ncontaining anhydrous potassium carbonate gave a minuscule amount of a\nproduct that was a two-component mixture.  This was resolved by dozens\nof separate injections into a preparatory gas chromatography system,\nallowing the isolation of the second of the two components in a\nquantity sufficient to demonstrate (by NMR spectroscopy) that it was\nthe desired 3-methoxy-4,5-ethylidinedioxybenzaldehyde.  Starting with\nthe pre-prepared dipotassium salt or the lead salt of the\ncatecholaldehyde gave nothing.  With no activity being found with\nMEDA, all was abandoned.\n\n\nThere are some comments made under MDA for successful chemistry (using\na different approach) alo#ng these lines when there is no methoxyl\ngroup present.  These are the compounds EDA and IDA.  But the\npharmacology was still not that exciting.",

The\npath can be humorous, it certainly can be tortuous, and it often calls\nfor special things such as faith, insight, and intuition.  But can one\nsay that it is logical?\n\n\n\tLogic is a tricky thing to evaluate.  One of the earliest\napproaches was laid down by Aristotle, in the form of the syllogism.\nIn it there are three lines consisting of two premises and a\nconclusion, a form that is called a \"mood.\" All are statements of\nrelationships and, if the premises are true, there are only certain\nconclusions that may logically follow.  For example:\n\n\n     Every man is a lover.\n     Every chemist is a man.\n     Therefore, every chemist is a lover.\n\n\n\nLetting lover be the major term \"a\" and letting chemist be the minor\nterm \"b\" and letting man be the middle term \"m\", this reduces to:\n\n\n     Every m is a,\n     Every b is m.\n     Therefore, every b is a\n\n\n\nand it is a valid mood called Barbara.\n\n\nOf the 256 possible combinations of all's and some's and none's and\nare's and are-not's, only 24 moods are valid.  The reasoning here with\nMDPH goes:\n\n\n     Some stimulants when given a methylenedioxy ring are MDMA-like.\n     Some ring-unsubstituted 1,1-dimethylphenylethylamines are stimulants.\n     Therefore, some ring-unsubstituted 1,1-dimethylphenylethyl\t\t\n\t  amines when given a methylenedioxy ring are MDMA-like.\n\n\n\nIn symbolic form this is:\n\n\n     Some m is a, and\n     Some b is m, then\n     Some b is a\n\n\n\nand this is not one of the 24 valid moods.  Given the first premise as\nsome m is a, there is only one valid syllogism form that can follow,\nand this is known as Disamis, or:\n\n\n     Some m is a, and\n     Every m is b, then\n     Some b is a\n\n\n\nwhich translates as:\n\n\n     Some stimulants when given a methylenedioxy group are MDMA-like.\n     Every stimulant is a ring-unsubstituted 1,1-dimethylphenyl\tethylamine.\n     Therefore, some ring-unsubstituted 1,1-dimethylphenylethyl\t\t\n\t  amines when given a methylenedioxy group are MDMA-like.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is the same.  But the second premise is false so the\nentire reasoning is illogical.  What is the false second premise?  It\nis not a fact that every stimulant is a phentermine.  There are lots\nof stimulants that are not phentermines.\n\n\nSo much for applying syllogistics to pharmacology.",

So why is this drug not\nactive?  The usual reason advanced by the pharmacologists is that the\nbody is full of potent enzymes known as monoamine oxidases, and this\nis a monoamine, and so the body simply chews away on it in an\noxidative manner, inactivating it before it ever makes it to some\ntarget receptor.\n\n\nThat is the pitch given in the textbooks.  Phenethylamines are subject\nto easy enzymatic oxidation, hence they are not active.  The presence\nof an alpha-methyl group (the corresponding amphetamines) blocks the\ncompound from easy access to the enzyme, and since that protects them\nfrom oxidative destruction, they are active.  The oft-quoted exception\nis mescaline, and even it is largely destroyed, as evidenced by the\nlarge amount needed for activity (a fraction of a gram).  Sorry, I\ncan't buy it.  This entire book is peppered with phenethylamines that\nare active at the few-milligram area.  Why aren't they also destroyed\nas well?  The textbooks simply are not right.\n\n\nMDPEA was one of the seven compounds evaluated as to toxicity and\nanimal behavior at the University of Michigan under contract from the\nArmy Chemical Center.  Its Edgewood Arsenal code number was EA-1297.\nThe number for MDA itself was EA-1298.\n\n\nThe beta-hydroxy analogue of MDPEA is the ethanolamine MDE, standing\nfor methylenedioxyethanolamine.  This is an old term, and in the more\nrecent literature, since 1975 certainly, MDE has been used to\nrepresent methylenedioxyethylamphetamine.  The ethanolamine compound\nis discussed in the recipe for DME.\n\n\nThere is a family of compounds, to be discussed elsewhere, that is\ncalled the Muni-Metro (see under METHYL-J).  The simplest member is\nthis compound, MDPEA, and under its chemically acceptable synonym,\nhomopiperonylamine, it can be called RHS.  Following that code, then,\nthe N-methyl homologue of MDPEA is METHYL-H, and it has been looked\nat, clinically, as an antitussive agent.  N-METHYL-MDPEA, or METHYL-H,\nor N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine is effective in this role\nat dosages of about 30 milligrams, but I have read nothing that would\nsuggest that there were any central effects.

But the opposite direction is in many\nways more appealing, the in vivo conversion of MDA to MDOH.  Why more\nappealing?

At\nthis point of total tolerance, there was consumed (on day #7, at 9:00\nAM) 120 milligrams of MDA and the response to it was substantially\nnormal with proper chronology, teeth clench, and at most only a slight\ndecrease in mental change.  A complete holiday from any drug for\nanother 6 days led to the reversal of this tolerance, in that 120\nmilligrams of MDMA had substantially the full expected effects.  The\nfact that MDMA and MDA are not cross-tolerant strengthens the argument\nthat they act in different ways, and at different sites in the brain.\n\n\nA wide popularization of the social use of MDMA occurred in 1984-1985\nand, with the reported observation of serotonin nerve changes in\nanimal models resulting from the administration of the structurally\nsimilar drug MDA, an administrative move was launched to place it\nunder legal control.  The placement of MDMA into the most restrictive\ncategory of the Federal Controlled Substances Act has effectively\nremoved it from the area of clinical experimentation and human\nresearch.  The medical potential of this material will probably have\nto be developed through studies overseas.\n\n\nA word of caution is in order concerning the intermediate\n3,4-methylene-dioxyphenylacetone, which has also been called\npiperonylacetone.  A devilish ambiguity appeared in the commercial\nmarket for this compound, centered about its name.  The controversy\nfocused on the meaning of the prefix, piperonyl, which has two\nseparate chemical definitions.  Let me try to explain this fascinating\nchaos in non-chemical terms.  Piperonyl is a term that has been used\nfor a two-ring system (the methylenedioxyphenyl group) either without,\nor with, an extra carbon atom sticking off of the side of it.  Thus,\npiperonylacetone can be piperonyl (the two-ring thing without the\nextra carbon atom attached) plus acetone (a three carbon chain thing);\nthe total number of carbons sticking out, three.  Or, piperonylacetone\ncan be piperonyl (the two-ring thing but with the extra carbon atom\nattached) plus acetone (a three carbon chain thing); the total number\nof carbons sticking out, four.\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\nThe three carbon sticking out job gives rise to MDA and to MDMA and to\nmany homologues that are interesting materials discussed at length in\nthese Book II comments.  This is the usual item of commerce, available\nfrom both domestic and foreign suppliers.  But the four-carbon\nsticking out job will produce totally weird stuff without any apparent\nrelationship to psychedelics, psychoactives or psychotropics\nwhatsoever.  I know of one chemical supply house which supplied the\nweird compound, and they never did acknowledge their unusual use of\nthe term piperonyl.  There is a simple difference of properties which\nmight be of value.  The three carbon (correct) ketone is an oil with a\nsassafras smell that is always yellow colored.  The four carbon\n(incorrect) ketone has a weak terpene smell and is white and\ncrystalline.  There should be no difficulties in distinguishing these\ntwo compounds.  But unprincipled charlatans can always add mineral oil\nand butter yellow to otherwise white solids to make them into yellow\noils.  Caveat emptor.",

And with that slight\nadditional weight, the activity has disappeared.  On those occasions\nwhere research has shown a compound to be inactive, there has been\nsome study made that could be called a \"primer\" experiment.  Why not\ntake advantage of the fact that an \"inactive\" compound might well be\nsitting in some receptor site in the brain without doing anything?\nMight its presence, wherever it might be, have some effect if only a\nperson were to explore it in the correct way?  Might it augment or\ninterfere with the action of another compound?  Many experiments of\nthis kind have been performed, geared to milk additional information\nout of a new trial of a new material.\n\n\nHere is an example of a primer experiment that involved MDIP.  Some\nfive hours following an inactive trial with 120 milligrams of MDIP\n(maybe a slight disturbance at one hour, nothing at two hours) a\ncalibration dose of 80 milligrams of MDMA was taken.  The effects of\nthe MDMA were noted at the 33 minute point, and an honest plus one was\nachieved at one hour.  At this point a second 80 milligrams was added\nto the inventory that was already on board, and the general\nintoxication and the eye effects that followed were completely\nexplained by the MDMA alone.  It was obvious that the two drugs did\nnot see one-another.\n\n\nSometimes an experiment can involve the assay of an unknown material\nat the supplement time of an active drug.  This has been called\n\"piggybacking.\" Here is an example.  At the five hour point of an\nexperiment with 140 milligrams of MDE (this had been a light\nexperience, a plus one which had not laster more than two hours) a\ndosage of 200 milligrams of MDIP rekindled a +1 experience, a pleasant\nintoxication of the MDE sort, but one that was quite invested with\ntremor and some feelings of eye-popping.  It was almost as if the\nphysical toxic effects outweighed the mental virtues.  Imagine an\niceberg, with the bulk of its mass underwater.  The MDE had had its\nown modest effects, and had submerged into invisibility, and the\nresponse to a little bit of an otherwise inactive MDIP was to refloat\na bit of the otherwise unseeable MDE.",

If this\nmaterial does eventually prove to be active, it is going to require a\npretty hefty dose.  But it may well have some activity, as there have\nbeen reports in the forensic literature of its preparation, or at\nleast its intended preparation, in illicit laboratories.  It seems\nunlikely that much effort would be directed towards the synthesis of a\ncompletely inactive compound.\n\n\nThe reduced potency of MDDM has been exploited in an unexpected way.\nBased on the premise that the dialkylation of the amine group of\namphetamine makes the parent compound intrinsically less active but\nwithout interfering with its ability to enter the brain, a large\nnumber of materials have been explored to take advantage of this very\nproperty.  There is a need in medical diagnosis for agents that can\nallow various organs of the body to be visualized.  One of the most\npowerful modalities for this work is the positron camera, and the use\nof the unusual properties of the positron that allow it to work.  In\nthe art of positron emission tomography (PET), an emitted positron\n(from a radioactive and thus unstable atom) will quickly interact with\na nearby electron and all mass disappears with the complete conversion\nto energy.  The detection of the produced pair of annihilation gamma\nrays will establish with great exactness the line along which this\ninteraction occurred.  So if one were to put an unstable atom into a\ncompound that went to the tissue of the brain, and this atom were to\ndecay there, the resulting gamma rays would allow a \"photograph\" to be\nmade of the brain tissue.  One could in this way visualize brain\ntissue, and observe abnormalities.\n\n\nBut what is needed is a molecule that carries the unstable atom (and\nspecifically one that emits positrons) and one which goes to the brain\nas well.  One of the very best unstable atoms for the formation of\npositrons is iodine, where there is an isotope of mass 122 which is\nperfect for these needs.  And, of course, the world of the psychedelic\ndrugs is tailor-made to provide compounds that go to the brain.  But,\nthe last thing that the physician wants, with the diagnostic use of\nsuch tools, would be to have the patient bouncing around in some\nturned-on altered state of consciousness.\n\n\nSo the completely logical union of these requirements is to take a\ncompound such as DOI (carrying the needed atom and certainly going to\nthe brain) and put two methyl groups on the nitrogen (which should\nreduce the chances for conspicuous biological activity).  This\ncompound was made, and it does label the brain, and it has shown\npromise as a flow indicator in the brain, and it and several of its\nclose relatives are discussed in their own separate recipe, called\nIDNNA.",

This is a trick often used to\nprotect (for a step or series of steps) a position on the molecule,\nand allowing it to become free and available at a later part in a\nsynthetic scheme.  In pharmacology, however, it is often a\ndisappointment.  With most centrally active alkaloids, there is a\ntwo-carbon separation between the weak base that is called the\naromatic ring, and the strong base that is called the nitrogen.  This\nis what makes phenethylamines what they are.  The phen- is the\naromatic ring (this is a shortened form of prefix phenyl which is a\nword which came, in turn, from the simplest aromatic alcohol, phenol);\nthe ethyl is the two carbon chain, and the amine is the basic\nnitrogen.  If one carbon is removed, one has a benzylamine, and it is\nusually identified with an entirely different pharmacology, or is most\noften simply not active.  A vivid example is the narcotic drug,\nFentanyl.  The replacement of the phenethyl group, attached to the\nnitrogen atom with a benzyl group, virtually eliminates its analgesic\npotency.\n\n\nHere too, there appears to be little if any activity in the N-benzyl\nanalogue of MDA.  A number of other variations had been synthesized,\nand none of them ever put into clinical trial.  With many of them\nthere was an ongoing problem in the separation of the starting amine\nfrom the product amine.  Sometimes the difference in boiling points\ncould serve, and sometimes their relative polarities could be\nexploited. Sometimes, ion-pair extraction would work wonders.  But\noccasionally, nothing really worked well, and the final product had to\nbe purified by careful crystallization.\n\n\nSeveral additional N-homologues and analogues of MDA are noted here.\nThe highest alkyl group on the nitrogen of MDA to give a compound that\nhad been assayed, was the straight-chain butyl homologue, MDBU.  Six\nother N-alkyls were made, or attempted.  Isobutylamine hydrochloride\nand 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone were reduced with sodium\ncyanoborohydride in methanol to give\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(i)-butylamphetamine boiling at 95-105 °C at 0.15\nmm/Hg and giving a hydrochloride salt (MDIB) with a mp of 179-180 °C.\nAnal. (C14H22ClNO2) N.  The reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride of\na mixture of (t)-butylamine hydrochloride and\n3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone in methanol produced\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(t)-butylamphetamine (MDTB) but the yield was\nminiscule.  The amyl analog was similarly prepared from (n)-amylamine\nhydrochloride and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone in methanol to give\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-amylamphetamine which distilled at 110-120 °C at\n0.2 mm/Hg and formed a hydrochloride salt (MDAM) with a mp of 164-166\n°C.  Anal. (C15H24ClNO2) N.  A similar reaction with (n)-hexylamine\nhydrochloride and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone in methanol, with\nsodium cyanoborohydride, produced after acidification with dilute\nsulfuric acid copious white crystals that were water and ether\ninsoluble, but soluble in methylene chloride!  This sulfate salt in\nmethylene chloride was extracted with aqueous sodium hydroxide and the\nremaining organic solvent removed to give a residue that distilled at\n110-115 °C at 0.2 mm/Hg to give\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(n)-hexylamphetamine which, as the hydrochloride\nsalt (MDHE) had a mp of 188-189 °C.  Anal. (C16H26ClNO2) N.  An\nattempt to make the 4-amino-heptane analogue from the primary amine,\n3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone, and sodiumcyanoborohydride in\nmethanol seemed to progress smoothly, but none of the desired product\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(4-heptyl)-amphetamine could be isolated.  This\nbase has been named MDSE, with a SE for septyl rather than HE for\nheptyl, to resolve any ambiguities about the use of HE for hexyl.  In\nretrospect, it had been assumed that the sulfate salt would have\nextracted into methylene chloride, and the extraordinary partitioning\nof the sulfate salt of MDHE mentioned above makes it likely that the\nsulfate salt of MDSE went down the sink with the organic extracts of\nthe sulfuric acid acidified crude product.  Next time maybe ether as a\nsolvent, or citric acid as an acid.  With (n)-octylamine hydrochloride\nand 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone in methanol, with sodium\ncyanoborohydride, there was obtained\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(n)-octylamphetamine as a water-insoluble,\nether-insoluble sulfate salt.  This salt was, however, easily soluble\nin methylene chloride, and with base washing of this solution, removal\nof the solvent, and distillation of the residue (130-135 °C at 0.2\nmm/Hg) there was eventually gotten a fine hydrochloride salt (MDOC) as\nwhite crystals with a mp of 206-208 °C.  Anal. (C18H30ClNO2) N.\n\n\nAs to N,N-dialkylhomologues of MDA, the N,N-dimethyl has been\nseparately entered in the recipe for MDDM.  Two efforts were made to\nprepare the N,N-diethyl homologue of MDA.  The reasonable approach of\nreducing a mixture of diethylamine hydrochloride and\n3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone in methanol with sodium\ncyanoborohydride was hopelessly slow and gave little product.  The\nreversal of the functionality was successful.  Treatment of MDA (as\nthe amine) and an excess of acetaldehyde (as the carbonyl source) with\nsodium borohydride in a cooled acidic medium gave, after acid-base\nworkup, a fluid oil that distilled at 85-90 °C at 0.15 mm/Hg and was\nconverted in isopropanol with concentrated hydrochloric acid to\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N,N-diethylamphetamine (MDDE) with a mp of 177-178\n°C.  Anal. (C14H22ClNO2) N.\n\n\nAnd two weird N-substituted things were made.  Aminoacetonitrile\nsulfate and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone were reduced in methanol\nwith sodium cyanoborohydride to form\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-cyanomethylamphetamine which distilled at about\n160 °C at 0.3 mm/Hg and formed a hydrochloride salt (MDCM) with a mp\nof 156-158 °C after recrystallization from boiling isopropanol. Anal.\n(C12H15ClN2O2) N.  During the synthesis of MDCM, there appeared to\nhave been generated appreciable ammonia, and the distillation provided\na fore-run that contained MDA.  The desired product had an acceptable\nNMR, with the N-cyanomethylene protons as a singlet at 4.38 ppm.  A\nsolution of t-butylhydrazine hydrochloride and\n3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone in methanol was reduced with sodium\ncyanoborohydride and gave, after acid-basing and distillation at\n95-105 °C at 0.10 mm/Hg, a viscous amber oil which was neutralized in\nisopropanol with concentrated hydrochloric acid to provide\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(t)-butylaminoamphetamine hydrochloride (MDBA)\nwith a mp of 220-222 °C with decomposition.

Some years ago, I had a most difficult experience with a\nstrain of marijuana that was known by the name of DRED.  The only word\nthat I can use to describe my response to it is to say that I felt I\nhad been poisoned.

And the other\northo-position is, using this nomenclature, the 2-position, and with a\nmethyl group there, one would have MADAM-2.  I should make a small\napology for the choice of numbers.  MDMA is a 3,4-methylenedioxy\ncompound, and the least ambiguous numbering scheme would be to lock\nthe methylenedioxy group inescapably at the 3,4-place, letting the\nother ring position numbers fall where they may.  The rules of\nchemistry ask that if something is really a 3,4,6-orientation it\nshould be renumbered as a 2,4,5-orientation.  Let's quietly ignore\nthat request here.\n\n\nHow fascinating it is, that a small methyl group, something that is\nlittle more than one more minor bump on the surface of a molecule that\nis lumpy and bumpy anyway, can so effectively change the action of a\ncompound.  A big activity change from a small structure change usually\nimplies that the bump is at a vital point, such as a target of\nmetabolism or a point of critical fit in some receptor site.  And\nsince 6-MADAM can be looked upon as 6-bump-MDMA, and since it is at\nleast 3x less potent than MDMA, the implication is that the action of\nMDMA requires some unbumpiness at this position for its particular\naction.  There are suggestions that the body may want to put a\nhydroxyl group right there (a 6-hydroxy-dopamine act), and it couldn't\nif there was a methyl group right there.  The isopropylamine side\nchain may want a certain degree of swing-around freedom, and this\nwould be restricted by a methyl bump right next to it.  And there are\nall kinds of other speculations possible as to why that position\nshould be open.\n\n\nAnyway, MADAM-6 is not active.

I know only one way of finding out.  Make the Schiffs'\nbase between piperonal and cyclohexylamine, treat this with butyl\nlithium in hexane with some TMEDA present, add some\nN-methylformanilide, convert the formed benzaldehyde to a nitrostyrene\nwith nitroethane, reduce this with elemental iron to the\nphenylacetone, reduce this in the presence of methylamine with sodium\ncyanoborohydride, then taste the result.",

The Edgewood Arsenal code number for it was\nEA-1306.  All psychedelics are given properties that are something\nlike \"twice the potency of mescaline\" or \"twice as long-lived as\nmescaline.\" This simple drug is truly the central prototype against\nwhich everything else is measured.  The earliest studies with the\n\"psychotomimetic amphetamines\" had quantitative psychological numbers\nattached that read as \"mescaline units.\" Mescaline was cast in\nconcrete as being active at the 3.75 mg/kg level.

If a\nnew compound proved to be active at 30 milligrams, there was a M.U.\nlevel of 10 put into the published literature.  The behavioral\nbiologists were happy, because now they had numbers to represent\npsychological properties.  But in truth, none of this represented the\nmagic of this material, the nature of the experience itself.  That is\nwhy, in this Book II, there is only one line given to \"dosage,\" but a\nfull page given to \"qualitative comments\".\n\n\nFour simple N-modified mescaline analogues are of interest in that\nthey are natural and have been explored in man.\n\n\nThe N-acetyl analogue has been found in the peyote plant, and it is\nalso a major metabolite of mescaline in man.  It is made by the gentle\nreaction of mescaline with acetic anhydride (a bit too much heat, and\nthe product N-acetyl mescaline will cyclize to a dihydroisoquinoline,\nitself a fine white crystalline solid, mp 160-161 °C) and can be\nrecrystallized from boiling toluene.  A number of human trials with\nthis amide at levels in the 300 to 750 milligrams range have shown it\nto be with very little activity.  At the highest levels there have\nbeen suggestions of drowsiness.  Certainly there were none of the\nclassic mescaline psychedelic effects.\n\n\nIf free base mescaline is brought into reaction with ethyl formate (to\nproduce the amide, N-formylmescaline) and subsequently reduced (with\nlithium aluminum hydride) it is converted to the N-methyl homologue.\nThis base has also been found as a trace component in the Peyote\ncactus.  And the effects of N-methylation of other psychedelic drugs\nhave been commented upon elsewhere in these recipes, all with\nconsistently negative results (with the noteworthy exception of the\nconversion of MDA to MDMA).  Here, too, there is no obvious activity\nin man, although the levels assayed were only up to 25 milligrams.\n\n\nN,N-Dimethylmescaline has been given the trivial name of Trichocerine\nas it has been found as a natural product in several cacti of the\nTrichocereus Genus but, interestingly, never in any Peyote variant.\nIt also has proven inactive in man in dosages in excess of 500\nmilligrams, administered parenterally.  This observation, the absence\nof activity of a simple tertiary amine, has been exploited in the\ndevelopment of several iodinated radiopharmaceuticals that are\nmentioned elsewhere in this book.\n\n\nThe fourth modification is the compound with the nitrogen atom\noxidatively removed from the scene.  This is the mescaline metabolite,\n3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid, or TMPEA.  Human dosages up to 750\nmilligrams orally failed to produce either physiological or\npsychological changes.\n\n\nOne additional manipulation with some of these structures has been\nmade and should be mentioned.  These are the analogues with an oxygen\natom inserted between the aromatic ring and the aliphatic chain.  They\nare, in essence, aminoethyl phenyl ethers.  The first is related to\nmescaline itself, 2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenoxy)ethylamine.  Human trials\nwere conducted over the dose range of 10 to 300 milligrams and there\nwere no effects observed.  The second is related to trichocerine,\nN,N-dimethyl-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenoxy)ethylamine.  It was inactive\nin man over the range of 10 to 400 milligrams.  Mescaline, at a dose\nof 420 milligrams, served as the control in these studies.",

    description: "It looks as if this compound is not active.\nThere is an excellent argument as to why it really should be, and the\nfact that it is not active is completely unexpected.  Let me try to\nexplain.\n\n\nQuite simply, mescaline is a major component and a centrally active\nalkaloid of the Peyote plant.  It is a phenethylamine, which can\nundergo a cyclization within the plant to produce a pile of\nderivatives (tetrahydroisoquinolines) such as anhalonine and\nO-methylanhalonidine that are marvelously complex alkaloids, all\nnatural components of this magical cactus.  But there is another pile\nof derivatives (tetrahydroisoquinolines) such as anhalonine, and\nlophophorine, and peyophorine which are the logical cyclization\nproducts of another phenethylamine which does not exist in the cactus.\nIt should be there, but it is not.  If it were there it would be the\nnatural precursor to a host of bicyclic alkaloids, but it is absent.\nThis is 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenethylamine.  I feel that some\nday it will be discovered as a plant component, and when it is it can\nbe given a name that reflects the generic binomial of the plant.  And\nsince the plant has been known as Lophophora williamsii, why not give\na name to this compound (which should be in the plant), one derived\nfrom the Latin name, but one that has never before been used?  What\nabout LOPHOPHINE?  And so, I have named it, but I have not found it,\nnor has anyone else.  Yet.\n\n\nIt is inevitable that this simple and most appealing precursor will be\nfound to be present in the cactus, at some future time when we will\nhave tools of sufficient sensitivity to detect it.  And certainly, it\nwould be reasonable to expect it to be an active psychedelic, and to\nbe as interesting in man as its close cousin, mescaline.  But, at the\npresent time, LOPHOPHINE is not known to be present in the plant, and\nit is not known to be active in man.  I am confident that both\nstatuses will change in the future.",

    description: "In general, all subjects who have explored\nJ have accepted it and commented favorably.  Perhaps those who have\nused supplements (in an imitation of the common MDMA procedure)\nachieved an additional period of effect, but also tended to drop to\nbaseline afterwards more rapidly.  The physical side effects, such as\nteeth clench and nystagmus, were infrequent.  The consensus is that J\nis a bit more \"stoning\" than MDMA, more like MDA, but with a\nchronology that is very much the same.\n\n\nTwo nomenclature problems have to be faced in the naming of these\ncompounds.  One deals with the Chemical Abstracts terminology as\ncontrasted with the logical and intuitive terminology.  The other\ninvokes the concept of the Muni-Metro, delightfully simple, but\nneither Chemical Abstracts-approved nor intuitive in form.  The first\nproblem is addressed here; the second is discussed where it better\nbelongs, under the N-methyl homologue of J (see under METHYL-J).\n\n\nIn short, the two-ring system of J, or of any of the MDA-MDMA family\nof drugs, can be named as one ring being attached to the other, or by\na single term that encompasses both.  The first procedure, an old\nfriend with chemists and the one that had been used for years in the\nabstracting services, calls the combination methylenedioxybenzene and,\nas a prefix, it becomes methylenedioxyphenyl-something.  The benzene\nor the phenyl-something is the foundation of the name, and there\nhappens to be a methylenedioxy-ring attached to it.  On this basis,\nthis compound J should be named as if it had no methylenedioxy ring\nanywhere, and then simply attach the new ring as an afterthought.  So,\nthe one-ring parent of J is 1-phenyl-2-aminobutane, and J is\n1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane (or, to be a purist, the\namino should alphabetically come first, to give\n2-amino-1-(3,4-methylene-dioxyphenyl)butane).  The synthesis of the\nchemical intermediates given above uses this old-fashioned\nnomenclature.\n\n\nBut the name currently in vogue for this two-ring system is\n1,3-benzodioxole.  As a prefix it becomes\n1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl-something, and so J would be called\n1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-aminobutane.  This is the source of the\ncode name BDB.  And the N-methyl homologue, the alpha-ethyl analogue\nof MDMA, is named MBDB, or METHYL-J, and is with its own separate\nentry in this footnote.\n\n\nThere is a psychological nuance to this new nomenclature.  The virtues\nand potential medical value of MDMA lie in its most remarkable\nproperty of facilitating communication and introspective states\nwithout an overlay of psychedelic action.  This property has prompted\nthe coining of a new pharmacological class name, Entactogen, which\ncomes from the Greek roots for \"touching within.\" But MDMA has been\nbadly smeared in both the public and the scientific view, by its wide\npopular misuse, its precipitous placement into a Schedule I category\nof the Federal Drug Law, and a flood of negative neurotoxicological\nfindings in animal studies.  There are some properties of both this\ncompound and its methyl-homologue that suggest this \"entactogen\"\nworld, so why not avoid the \"MD\" prefix that, in many eyes, is\npejorative?  Stick with the totally obscure chemical names, and call\nthem BDB and MBDB.  Or, even more simply, J and METHYL-J.",

    description: "This is one of the ten Classic Ladies, the\nten possible homologues of DOM, which I had discussed under ARIADNE\n(the first of the Ladies).  The active level is unknown, but it is\nhigher than 9 milligrams (the highest dose tried) and since DOM itself\nwould have been smashingly active at this level, it is obvious that\nIRIS is a homologue with decreased potency.\n\n\nThis lack of activity brings up a fascinating point.  I have referred\nto a drug's action on the mind, quite frequently in these notes, with\nthe phrase \"reasonably complex.\" By that, I do not mean that a drug's\naction simply shows many facets, and if these were to be tallied, the\ndrug-mind interaction would become clear.  There is quite a bit of\nimportance intrinsically implied by the term, complex.  Simple things,\nas we have come to appreciate and depend upon them in our day-to-day\nliving, can have simple explanations.  By this, I mean explanations\nthat are both completely satisfactory and satisfactorily complete.\nAnswers that have all the earmarks of being correct.  What is the sum\nof two plus three, you ask?  Let's try five.  And for most of our\nneeds, five is both factual and complete.\n\n\nBut some years ago, a mathematician named Gödel devised a proof for a\ntheorem that anything that is reasonably complex cannot enjoy this\nluxury (I believe he used the word \"interesting\" rather than\nreasonably complex).  If your collection of information is factual, it\ncannot be entirely complete.  And if it is complete, it cannot be\nentirely factual.  In short, we will never know, we cannot ever know,\nevery fact that constitutes an explanation of something.  A complete\nbook of knowledge must contain errors, and an error-free book of\nknowledge must be incomplete.\n\n\nThere is a small warning light deep inside me that starts flashing any\ntime I hear someone begin to advance an explanation of some reasonably\ncomplex phenomenon with an air of confidence that implies, \"Here is\nhow it works.\"  What the speaker usually has is an intense familiarity\nwith one particular discipline or specialty and the phenomenon is\nviewed through those eyes, often with the assurance that looking at it\nthat way, intently enough and long enough, will reveal the complete\nexplanation.  And be attentive to the phrase, \"We are not yet\ncom-pletely sure of exactly how it works.\"  What is really meant is,\n\"We haven't the slightest idea of how it really works.\"\n\n\nI must admit to some guilt in this matter, certainly as much as the\nnext person.  I am a chemist and I suspect that the way that the\npsychedelic drugs do their thing can eventually be understood through\na comparison of the structures of the molecules that are active and\nthose that are inactive.  I put those that have methoxyl groups in\npigeon hole #1, and those that are bicyclic into pigeon hole #2.  And\nthen, if pigeon hole #2 becomes more and more cluttered, I will\nsubdivide the contents into pigeon hole #2A for bicyclics with\nheteroatoms and pigeon hole #2B for bicyclics without heteroatoms.\nThe more information I can accumulate, the more pigeon holes I need.\n\n\nBut in the adjoining lab, there is a molecular biologist who feels\nthat the eventual explanation for the action of the psychedelic drug\nwill come from the analysis and understanding of the intimate geometry\nof the places in the brain where they act.  These classification\npigeon holes are called receptor sites.  But they, too, can become\nmore and more subdivided as they become cluttered.  One reads of a new\nsub-sub type quite regularly in the literature.  The favorite\nneurotransmitter of the moment, as far as the current thinking of how\nthese marvelous drugs work, is serotonin, or 5-HT (for\n5-hydroxytryptamine).  There are 5-HT1 and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B and (for\nall I know right now) 5-HT2C and 5-HT2D receptors, and I don't really\nthink that either he or I have come much closer to understanding the\nmechanism of action.\n\n\nAnd, since the mind is a reasonably complex system, Gödel has already\ninformed us both that neither of us will be completely successful.\nSometimes I feel that the pigeon hole approach to the classification\nof knowledge might actually limit our views of the problem.  A Harvard\nProfessor of Medicine recently noted: \"We must recognize for what it\nis, man's predilection for dividing things into tidy categories,\nirrespective of whether clarity is gained or lost thereby.\"\n\n\nNo.  No one will ever have it all together.  It is like sitting down\nin front of a jigsaw with a zillion zillion pieces spread all over the\nkitchen table.  With diligent searching you will occasionally find a\npiece that matches another, but it rarely provides any insight into\nthe final picture.  That will remain a mystery, unless you had the\nchance to see the cover of the box in some other incarnation.  But Oh\nmy, what fun it is, whenever you do happen to find a new piece that\nfits!\n\n\nThis harangue is really a lengthy prelude to the story of putting an\nethoxy group in place of a methoxy on the 2,5-dimethoxy skeleton of\nthese psychedelic families.  The making of IRIS was the first move in\nthis direction, done back in 1976.  One can have a pigeon hole that is\nnamed \"Ethoxy In Place of Methoxy\" and toss in there the names of\nperhaps twenty pairs of compounds, which differ from one another by\njust this feature.  Yet when they are looked at from the potency point\nof view, there are some which show a decrease in potency (which is the\ncase with IRIS and most of the Tweetios) and there are some which seem\nto maintain their potency (such as the TMA-2/MEM pair) and there are\nsome where there is a distinct potency increase (the\nmescaline/escaline pair, for example).\n\n\nWhat does one do to clarify the contents of this particular pigeon\nhole?  The current fad would be to subdivide it into three\nsubdivisions, maybe something like \"Ethoxy in Place of Methoxy if 2-\nor 5-located\" and \"Ethoxy in Place of Methoxy if 4-located and other\nthings 2,5\" and \"Ethoxy in Place of Methoxy if 4-located, and other\nthings 3,5.\" The end point that soon becomes apparent, down the line,\nwill be to have as many pigeon holes as compounds!  And at the moment,\nthis particular piece of the jigsaw puzzle doesn't seem to fit\nanywhere at all.\n\n\nPerhaps both my neighboring molecular biologist and I are asking the\nwrong questions.  I am looking at the molecules and asking, \"What are\nthey?\" And he is following them and asking, \"Where do they go?\" And\nneither of us is fully attentive to the question, \"What do they do?\"\nIt is so easy to replace the word \"mind,\" in our inquiries, with the\nword \"brain.\"\n\n\nYup.  The operation of the mind can certainly be classified as a\n\"reasonably complex\" phenomenon.  I prefer Gödel's term.  The mind is\nwithout question an \"interesting\" phenomenon.",

The preparation of\nit would require access through the O-isopropoxylation product with\nsyringaldehyde, followed by nitrostyrene formation with nitroethane,\nfollowed by reduction probably with lithium aluminum hydride.  It has\nnot been synthesized, as far as I know, and so it has probably not\nbeen evaluated in man.  What would be the active level?  It would\nprobably be more potent than IP, but I would guess not by much.  Maybe\nin the 30 milligram area.\n\n\nA moment's aside for a couple of the words that are so much a part of\nthe chemist's jargon.  Room temperature, as used above, means the\nnatural temperature that something comes to if it is put on the table\nand is neither heated nor cooled.  The phrase, I discovered during my\nyear at Gif, is completely un-understandable in French.  A room has no\ntemperature.  Only things in rooms have temperatures.  Their\nexpression is more exact.  The object achieves, in the French\nterminology, a temperature normale d'interieur, or about 15 to 16 °C.\nBut in common laboratory parlance it has become the temperature\nd'ambiance.\n\n\nAnd one finds the prefix \"iso\" used everywhere.  Considerable care\nshould be taken in the two different uses of the prefix \"iso\" in the\nnomenclature with the mescaline analogues.  In general, the term \"iso\"\nmeans the other one of two possibilities.  If you are allowed to paint\na house only with green paint or red paint, and green is the color you\nactually use, then red could be called iso-green.  With isoproscaline\n(here) there is a rearranging of the propyl group on the 4-oxygen of\nmescaline.  It has been replaced with its branched analogue, the other\nof two possibilities, the isopropyl group.  Everything is still with\nthe 3,4,5-orientation on the benzene ring.  However, with IM\n(isomescaline) there is a rearrangement of substitution pattern on the\nbenzene ring, with the repositioning of the trimethoxyl substitution\npattern from the 3,4,5- arrangement to the 2,3,4- arrangement.  It has\nbeen the side-chain that has taken the other of two possible\npositions.  The term \"iso\" must always be interpreted in precise\ncontext.",

In the\noriginal report, one finds: RThus we have discovered an extremely\nremarkable dependency of the intoxicating action upon the position of\nthe three methoxy groups.  Mescaline, the\n3,4,5-trimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine, produces in the normal subject a\nmuch stronger over-all intoxication than in the schizophrenic patient,\nwhereas 2,3,4-trimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine has quite the opposite\neffect.  It has little action in healthy individuals, being almost\nwithout intoxicating properties, but it is very potent in the\nschizophrenic.  The metabolic conversion products of the \"reciprocal\"\nmescaline will be further studied as soon as the study of the\nmetabolism of the proper mescaline is complete.\n\n\nThis is a pretty rich offering, and one that the present medical\ncommunity has no qualms about discarding.  At the bookkeeping level,\nthe promised further studies have never appeared, so all may be\nforgotten as far as potential new discoveries might be concerned.\n\n\nOne recent related study has been reported, tying together\nisomescaline and schizophrenia.  Through the use of radioactive\nlabelling, the extent of demethylation (the metabolic removal of the\nmethyl groups from the methoxyls) was determined in both schizophrenic\npatients and normal subjects.  When there was a loading of the person\nwith methionine (an amino acid that is the principal source of the\nbody's methyl groups), the schizophrenics appeared to show a lesser\namount of demethylation.\n\n\nBut might either of these two observations lead to a diagnostic test\nfor schizophrenia?

The illness has such social and genetic\ncontributions, that no simple measure of a response to an\nalmost-psychedelic, or minor shift of some urinary metabolite pattern\ncould possibly be believed.  No independent confirmation of these\nproperties has been reported.  But maybe these findings are valid.  A\nmajor problem in following these leads does not involve any complex\nresearch protocols.

    description: "This base, if it were given a code name\nbased upon its substituents arranged in their proper alphabetical\norder, would have to be called something like DNDIA, which is quite\nunpronounceable.  But by a rearrangement of these terms, one can\nachieve IDNNA (Iodo-Dimethoxy-N,N-dimethyl-Amphetamine) which has a\nnice lilt to it.\n\n\nOne of the major goals of research in nuclear medicine is a drug that\ncan be used to demonstrate the brain blood flow pattern.  To do this\njob, a drug should demonstrate four properties.  First, it must carry\na radioactive isotope that is a positron emitter (best, a fluorine or\nan iodine atom, for use with the positron camera) that can be put onto\nthe molecule quickly, synthetically, and which will stay on the\nmolecule, metabolically.  Second, as to brain entry, the drug should\nbe rapidly and extensively taken up by brain tissue, without being\nselectively absorbed or concentrated at any specific sites.  In other\nwords, it should go where the blood goes.  Thirdly, the absorption\nshould be strong enough that it will stay in the brain, and not be\nwashed out quickly.  This allows time to both locate and count the\nradioactivity that was carried in there.  And lastly, the drug must be\nwithout pharmacological action.\n\n\nIDNNA looked like a promising candidate when tried with a radioactive\niodine label, and there was quite a flurry of interest in using it\nboth as an ex-perimental drug, and as a prototype material for the\nsynthesis of structural variants.  It went in quickly, extensively and\nquite diffusely, and it stayed in for a long time.\n\n\nBut was it pharmacologically active?  Here one finds a tricky road to\nwalk.  The animal toxicity and behavioral properties can be determined\nin a straightforward manner.  Inject increasing amounts into an\nexperimental animal and observe him closely.  IDNNA was quite inert.\nBut, it is a very close analogue to the extremely potent psychedelic\nDOI, and it is widely admitted that animal assays are of no use in\ntrying to determine this specific pharmacological property.  So, a\nquiet human assay was called for.  Since it did indeed go into the\nbrain of experimental animals, it could quite likely go into the brain\nof man.  In fact, that would be a needed property if the drug were to\never become useful as a diagnostic tool.\n\n\nIt was assayed up to levels where DOI would have been active, and no\nactivity was found.  So one could state that it had none of the\npsychedelic properties of DOI at levels where DOI would be active\n(this, at 2.6 milligrams orally).  But you don't assay much higher,\nbecause sooner or later, something might indeed show up.  So it can be\nhonestly said, IDNNA is less active than DOI itself, in man.  Let's\nwave our hands a bit, and make our statement with aggressive\nconfidence.  IDNNA has shown no activity in the human CNS at any level\nthat has been evaluated.  This sounds pretty good.  Just don't go too\nfar up there, and don't look too carefully.  This is not as\nunscrupulous as it might sound since, in practical terms, the\nextremely high specific activities of the radioactive 122I that would\nbe used, would dictate that only an extremely small amount of the drug\nwould be required.  One would be dealing, not with milligram\nquantities, but with microgram quantities, or less.\n\n\nSome fifteen close analogues of IDNNA were prepared, to see if any had\na better balance of biological properties.  A valuable intermediate\nwas an iodinated ketone that could be used either to synthesize IDNNA\nitself or, if it were to be made radio-labelled, it would allow the\npreparation of any desired radioactive analogue in a single synthetic\nstep.  The iodination of p-dimethoxybenzene with iodine monochloride\nin acetic acid gave 2,5-diiodo-1,4-dimethoxybenzene as white crystals\nfrom acetonitrile, with a mp of 167-168 °C.  Anal. (C8H8I2O2) C,H.\nTreatment of this with an equivalent of butyllithium in ether,\nfollowed with N-methyl formanilide, gave\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodobenzaldehyde as pale yellow crystals from ethanol,\nwith a mp of 136-137 °C.  Anal. (C9H9IO3) C,H.  This, in solution in\nnitroethane with a small amount of anhydrous ammonium acetate, gave\nthe nitrostyrene 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-nitropropene as\ngold-colored crystals from methanol, mp 119-120 °C.  Anal.\n(C11H12INO4) C,H.  This was smoothly reduced with ele-mental iron in\nacetic acid to give 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylacetone as white\ncrystals from methylcyclopentane.  These melted at 62-63 °C and were\nboth spec-troscopically and analytically correct.  Anal. (C11H13IO3)\nC,H.\n\n\nThis intermediate, when reductively aminated with dimethylamine, gives\nIDNNA identical in all respects to the product from the dimethylation\nof DOI above.  But it has also been reacted with 131I NaI in acetic\nacid at 140 °C for 10 min, giving the radioactive compound by\nexchange, and this was reductively aminated with over a dozen amines\nto give radioactive products for animal assay.  There was produced in\nthis way, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-N-alkyl-amphetamine where the alkyl\ngroup was methyl, isopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, hexyl, dodecyl,\nbenzyl, cyanomethyl, and 3-(dimethylaminopropyl).  Several dialkyl\nhomologue were made, with the alkyl groups being dimethyl (IDNNA\nitself), diethyl, isopropyl-methyl, and benzyl-methyl.  These specific\nhomologues and analogues are tallied in the index, but a number of\nother things, such as hydrazine or hydroxylamine derivatives, were\neither too impure or made in amounts too small to be valid, and they\nare ignored.\n\n\nThe diethyl compound without the iodine is\n2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-diethylamphetamine, which was prepared by the\nreductive alkylation of DMA with acetaldehyde and sodium\ncyanoborohydride.  This product, DEDMA, was a clear white oil, bp\n82-92 °C at 0.15 mm/Hg which did not form a crystalline hydrochloride.\nAn interesting measure of just how different these N,N-dialkylated\nhomologues can be from the psychedelic primary amines,\npharmacologically, can be seen in the published report that the\nbeta-hydroxy derivative of DEDMA is an antitussive, with a potency the\nsame as codeine.\n\n\nNone of these many iodinated IDNNA analogues showed themselves to be\nsuperior to IDNNA itself, in the rat model, and none of them have been\ntasted for their psychedelic potential in man.",

    description: "Two virtues sought by some users of\npsychedelic drugs are high intensity and brief action.  They want a\nquicky.  Something that is really effective for a short period of\ntime, then lets you quickly return to baseline, and presumably back to\nthe real world out there.\n\n\nIntensity is often (but not always) regulated by dose.  The\npharmacological property of dose-dependency applies to many of these\ndrugs, in that the more you take, the more you get.  If you want more\nintensity, take a second pill.  And often, you get a longer duration\nas an added property.  But it is instructive to inquire into the\nrationale that promotes brevity as a virtue.  I believe that it says\nsomething concerning the reasons for using a psychedelic drug.  A\ntrade off between learning and entertainment.  Or between the\nachieving of something and the appearance of achieving something.  Or,\nin the concepts of the classics, between substance and image.\n\n\nIn a word, many people truly believe that they cannot afford the time\nor energy required for a deep search into themselves.  One has to make\na living, one has to maintain a social life, one has a multitude of\nobligations that truly consume the oh-so-few hours in the day.  I\nsimply cannot afford to take a day off just to indulge myself in\nsuch-and-such (choose one: digging to the bottom of a complex concept,\ngiving my energies to those whom I can help, to search out my inner\nstrengths and weaknesses) so instead I shall simply do such-and-such\n(choose one: read the book review, go to church on Sunday morning, use\na short-acting psychedelic).  The world is too much with us.  This may\nbe a bit harsh, but there is some merit to it.\n\n\nHOT-17 is by no means a particularly potent compound.  The hundred\nmilligram area actually has been the kiss of death to several\nmaterials, as it is often at these levels that some physical concerns\nbecome evident.  And it certainly is not a short lived compound.  But,\nas has been so often the case, the long lived materials have proven to\nbe the most memorable, in that once the entertainment aspect of the\nexperience is past you, there is time for dipping deeply into the rich\nareas of the thought process, and the working through of ideas and\nconcepts that are easily available.  And when this access is coupled\nto the capability of talking and writing, then a rewarding experience\nis often the result.\n\n\nAs with the parent compound, 2C-T-17 itself, the presence of an\nasym-metric carbon atom out there on the (s)-butyl side chain will\nallow the separation of HOT-17 into two components which will be\ndifferent and distinct in their actions.  The activity of the racemic\nmixture often is an amalgamation of both sets of properties, and the\nseparate assay of each component can often result in a fascinating and\nunexpected fractionation of these properties.",

    description: "There is a working hypothesis that has been\ngrowing in substance over the last few years in this strange and\nmarvelous area of psychedelic drugs.  It all was an outgrowth of the\nrather remarkable coincidence that I had mentioned in the discussion\nthat followed MDOH.  There, an assay of what was thought to be MDOH\ngave a measure of activity that was substantially identical to MDA,\nand it was later found out that the material had decomposed to form\nMDA.  So, MDA was in essence rediscovered.  But when the true, valid,\nand undecomposed sample of MDOH was actually in hand, and assayed in\nits own rights, it was found to have a potency that really was the\nsame as MDA.  So, the working hypothesis goes something like this:\n\n\nAN N-HYDROXY AMINE HAS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME POTENCY AND THE SAME\nACTION AS ITS N-HYDROGEN COUNTERPART.\n\n\nMaybe the N-hydroxy compound reduces to the N-H material in the body,\nand the latter is the intrinsically active agent.  Maybe the N-H\nmaterial oxidizes to the N-hydroxy material in the body, and the\nlatter is the intrinsically active agent.  Either direction is\nreasonable, and there is precedent for each.  The equivalence of MDA\nand MDOH was the first suggestion of this.  And I have made a number\nof NH vs. NOH challenges of this hypothesis.  The interesting 2C-T-X\nseries has provided a number of amines that are amenable to\nN-hydroxylation, and this is the first of them.  And, after all, if\nyou put a hydroxy (HO) group on a thio material (T), you have a HOT\ncompound.\n\n\nSo, as far as nomenclature is concerned, the family of N-hydroxy\nanalogues of N-H amines is known as the HOT family.\n\n\nHow does HOT-7 compare with 2C-T-7?  They are almost identical.  The\nsame range of dose (centering on 20 milligrams) and if anything,\nperhaps slightly less long lived.  Lets try some other N-hydroxys!",

    description: "This compound was the seventh of the ten\npossible Classic Ladies.  I have mentioned the concept already under\nthe discussions on ARIADNE.  This is the teutonic replacement of each\nof the distinguishable hydrogen atoms of DOM with a methyl group.  The\nfindings with GANESHA were a total surprise.  The extension of a\nhydrogen in the 3-position of DOM with a methyl group should have a\nminor influence on its steric association with whatever receptor site\nmight be involved.  A much greater impact might come not from the size\nof the group but from its location.  This, coupled with a full order\nof magnitude of decrease in potency, seemed to call for an involvement\nof that particular position as being one that is affected by\nmetabolism.  And since the activity is decreased, the obvious role is\nin the blocking of the metabolic promotion of DOM-like things to\nactive intermediates.\n\n\nThe remarkable point being emphasized here is that the placement of a\ndull methyl group at a dull position of the DOM molecule actually\ninactivated (for all intents and purposes) the activity of DOM.  It is\nnot the presence of the methyl that has decimated the potency, but the\nremoval of the hydrogen atom.\n\n\nHow can such a hypothesis be explored?  A historic premise of the\nmedicinal chemist is that if a structure gives an unusual response in\na receptor, vary it slightly and see how the response varies.  This is\nexactly the principle that led to the ten Classic Ladies, and with\nthis particular Lady (who actually turned out to be a gentleman), the\nsame concept should hold.  There are two involved methyl groups in\nGANESHA, one at the 3-position and one at the 4-position.  Why not\nhomologate each to an ethyl group, and as a wrap up make both of them\ninto ethyl groups.  Look at the differences along two lines of\nvariation; the effects of the homologation of the 3- and 4-positions,\ncoupled with the effects of the homologation intrinsic in the\ncomparison of the two-carbon chain of the phenethylamine with the\nthree-carbon chain of the amphetamine.\n\n\nThere are thus six compounds involved in such a study.  And they have\nbeen named (as have all the other GANESHA analogues) in accordance\nwith the collective carbon inventory in and about these two ring\npositions.  The first two compounds are related to DOET and to 2C-E.\nMaintain the methyl group at the 3-position but homologate the\n4-position to an ethyl.  The ring pattern would become\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-3-methyl, and the phenethylamine and amphetamine\nwould be called 2C-G-12 and G-12 respectively (a one carbon thing, the\nmethyl, at position-3 and a two carbon thing, an ethyl, at\nposition-4).  Reversal of these groups, the 3-ethyl homologues of 2C-D\nand DOM would thus become 2C-G-21 and G-21.  And, finally, the diethyl\nhomologues would be 2C-G-22 and G-22.  In each of these cases, the\npaired numbers give the lengths of the chains at the two positions,\nthe 3- and the 4-positions that are part of the GANESHA concept.  And\nthis code is easily expandable to longer things such as 2C-G-31 and\n2C-G-41, which would be the 3-propyl-4-methyl, and the\n3-butyl-4-methyl homologues, resp.\n\n\nUnfortunately, these six initially proposed compounds have so far\nresisted all logical approaches to synthesis, and are at present still\nunknown.  What has been successfully achieved, the building up of a\nbig bulky hydrocarbon glob at these positions, has rather unexpectedly\nled to a remarkable enhancement of potency.  As with all true\nexploration into areas of the unknown, the deeper you get, the less\nyou understand.",

There seems to be no bodily threat to\ndiscourage further exploration, but there simply was not the drive to\nexplore it much.  The comments concerning the enlargement of the ring\nsystem (mentioned under 2C-G-5) are equally valid here.  The\n\"shrubbery\" that is the hallmark of the Ganesha family is, with G-5,\nabout as bulky as has ever been put onto a centrally active molecule.\nThe norbornane group has a one carbon bridge and a two carbon bridge\nsticking out of it at odd angles.  The replacement of the one-carbon\nbridge with a second two-carbon bridge would make the compound G-6.\nIt would be makeable, but is there really a driving reason to do so?\nThere is a simplification intrinsic in this, in that G-5 actually has\ntwo centers of asymmetry (the alpha-carbon atom on the amphetamine chain,\nand the norbornyl area itself) and so it is really a mixture of two\nracemic diastereoisomers.  G-6 would still be a racemate, but it would\nbe only a single compound, as are all the other substituted\namphetamine derivatives.\n\n\nSomeday I may try making G-6, but it's not a high priority right now.",

    description: "Most people who were involved with the\nevaluation of FLEA quite logically compared it with MDMA, as it was\npresented as being a very close analogue which might share some of the\nlatter's properties.  And to a large measure, the comparison was\nfavorable.  The dosages are almost identical, the chronological course\nof action is almost identical, and there are distinct similarities in\nthe effects that are produced.  If there is a consensus of\nsimilarities and differences it would be that it is not quite as\nenabling in allowing a closeness to be established with others.  And\nperhaps there is more of a move towards introspection.  And perhaps a\nslightly increased degree of discoordination in the thought processes.\nBut also, part of this same consensus was that, were MDMA unknown,\nthis material would have played its role completely.\n\n\nAnd from the scientific point of view, it lends more weight to a\nhypothesis that just might be a tremendous research tool in\npharmacology.  I first observed the intimate connection between an\namine and a hydroxylamine with the discovery that N-hydroxy-MDA (MDOH)\nwas equipotent and of virtually identical activity to the\nnon-hydroxylated counterpart (MDA).  And I have speculated in the\nrecipe for MDOH about the possible biological interconversions of\nthese kinds of compounds.  And here, the simple addition of a hydroxyl\ngroup to the amine nitrogen atom of MDMA produces a new drug that is\nin most of its properties identical to MDMA.  The concept has been\nextended to 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and 2C-T-17, where each of these three\nactive compounds was structurally modified in exactly this way, by the\naddition of a hydroxyl group to the amine nitrogen atom.  The results,\nHOT-2, HOT-7 and HOT-17 were themselves all active, and compared very\nclosely with their non-hydroxylated prototypes.\n\n\nJust how general might this concept be, that an N-hydroxyl analog of\nan active amine shall be of similar action and duration as the parent\ndrug?  What if it really were a generality!  What havoc it would wreak\nin the pharmaceutical industry!  If I could patent the concept, then I\nwould be able to make parallel best sellers to all of the primary and\nsecondary amines out there in the industry.  Perhaps 90% of all the\ncommercially available drugs that are concerned with the human mental\nstate are amines.  And a goodly number of these are primary or\nsecondary amines.  And each and every one of these could be converted\nto its N-hydroxyl analogue, effectively by-passing the patent\nprotection that the originating corporation so carefully crafted.  An\nexample, just for fun.  A run-away best seller right now is an\nantidepressant called fluoxetine, with the trade name Prozac.  I will\nmake a small wager that if I were to synthesize and taste\nN-hydroxy-N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-((a,a,a-trifluoro-p-tolyl)oxy)propylamine,\nI would find it to be an active antidepressant.  Remember, Mr. Eli\nLilly and Company; you read about it first, right here!\n\n\nOf course, I was asked, why call it FLEA?  The origin was in a classic\nbit of poetry.  A commonly used code name for MDMA was ADAM, and I had\ntried making several modest modifications of the MDMA structure in the\nsearch for another compound that would maintain its particular music\nwithout the annoying tooth-grinding and occasional nystagmus, or\neye-wiggle, that some users have mentioned.  One of these was the\n6-methyl homologue which was, with some perverse logic, called MADAM.\nAnd, following this pattern, the 6-fluoroanalogue was to be FLADAM.\nSo, with the N-hydroxy analogue, what about HADAM?  Which brought to\nmind the classic description of Adam's earliest complaint, an\ninfestation of fleas.  The poem was short and direct.  \"Adam had 'em.\"\nSo, in place of HAD 'EM, the term FLEA jumped into being.",

It had a\ncertain swing to it.  F-22, like LSD-25.  And here it was finished,\njust five days before I had to deliver a paper concerning the\nsyntheses (and activities!) of all these dihydrobenzofurans to the\nmarijuana congress.  Could this possibly be another LSD?  I was\nsufficiently convinced that the possibility was real, that I actually\nstarted the screening process at a most unusually low level of 10\nmicrograms.  Two days later, I upped this to a dose of 25 micrograms\n(no activity again) and three days after that, at 1 AM on the polar\nflight to Copenhagen, I swallowed the \"monstrous\" dose of 50\nmicrograms.  Shoot the works.  If I were to blossom all over the\ntourist section of the SAS plane, well, it would be quite a paper to\ngive.  If not, I could always say something like, \"The active level\nhas not yet been found.\" No activity.  Another Walter Mitty fantasy\ndown the tubes.\n\n\nAnd, as it turned out, the entire project pretty much ran out of\nsteam.  A number of clever analogs had been started, and would have\nbeen pursued if there had been any activity promised of any kind with\nany of these dihydrobenzofurans.  The \"other\" benzaldehyde described\nabove, could have been run in a manner parallel to that proposed for\nthe counterpart with F-2, to make the eventual amphetamine,\n7-(2-aminopropyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.  Great\nstrides had been made towards F-233 (I have discussed the naming\nsystem under F-2, with the F standing for the furan of benzofuran and\nthe 2 and 3 and 3 being the positions of the methyl groups on it).\nThe reaction of 4-methoxyphenol with 1-chloro-3-methyl-2-butene gave\nthe ether which underwent the thermal Claisen rearrangement to\n2-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-4-methoxyphenol with a bp of 148-157 °C at 30\nmm/Hg.  This was cyclized to the intermediate cycle\n2,3,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran which, after distillation, was\nshown to be only 80% pure by GC analysis.  This was, nonetheless, (and\nwith the hope that is in the very fiber of a young innocent chemist),\npushed on to the benzaldehyde stage (and there were a\nnot-too-surprising four benzaldehydes to be found in the oil that was\nproduced, which refused to crystallize).  And then (when sheer\ndesperation replaced hope) these were condensed with nitroethane to\nform an even worse mixture.  Maybe something might crystallize from\nit?  Nothing ever did.  Junk.  Everything was simply put on the shelf\nwhere it still rests today, and F-233,\n6-(2-aminopropyl)-5-methoxy-2,3,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran,\nremains the stuff of speculation.\n\n\nAnd a start towards F-23,\n6-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dimethyl-5-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, got\njust as far as the starting ether, when it occurred to me that the\nfinal product would have an unprecedented three chiral centers, and so\na total of four racemic pairs of diastereoisomers.  And then I\ndiscovered that the starting allyl halide, crotyl chloride, was only\n80% pure, with the remaining 20% being 3-chloro-1-butene.  This would\nhave eventually produced a 2-ethyl-analogue,\n6-(2-aminopropyl)-2-ethyl-5-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, with its\ntwo chiral centers and two more pairs of stereoisomers (not to speak\nof the need to devise an entirely new coding system).  Unless\nsomething were to fall into my lap as a crystalline intermediate, the\nfinal mess could have had at least six discreet compounds in it, not\neven considering optical isomers.  And I haven't even begun to think\nof making the six-membered dihydrobenzopyrans which were the THC\nanalogues that presented the rationale that started the whole project\nin the first place.  A recent issue of the Journal of Medicinal\nChemistry has just presented an article describing the reaction of\n6-methoxytetrahydrobenzopyran with dichloromethyl methyl ether, and\napproximately equal amounts of all three of the possible isomers were\nobtained.  That would have been the first step towards making the\nprototypic compound 7-(2-aminopropyl)\n6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzopyran.  Just as the benzofurans were\nall named as F-compounds, this, as a benzopyran, would have been a P\ncompound, but P also is used for proscaline, and there would have been\nsome repair-work needed for these codes.\n\n\nTime to abandon ship.

Doses of 100 mg/Kg were without effects in mice following\ni.p. injections, although half again this amount proved to be lethal.\nIn rats trained to discriminate LSD from saline, F-2 proved to be\nabout 40 times less potent than the reference compound DOM, requiring\nsome 5 mg/Kg for positive responses.  But the human trials were only\nup to about 0.2 mg/Kg.\n\n\nThis was the prototype compound that was originally put together to\njustify giving a paper at a marijuana conference in Sweden, in 1968.\nAlthough I had never done much with marijuana or with its principal\ningredients, I thought maybe I could bend the topic a bit to embrace\nsome potentially active phenethylamines.  There is a story of an\ninternational conference held in Geneva a few years earlier to discuss\nthe worrisome decrease in the elephant population.  A German zoologist\ninvested a full eight-hour day in a summary of his 21 volume treatise\non the anatomy and the physiology of the elephant.  A French\nsociologist presented a lively slide show on the mating rituals and\nrutting behavior of the elephant.  And a rabbi from Tel Aviv entitled\nhis talk: \"Elephants and the Jewish Problem.\" My Swedish talk should\nhave been named \"Marijuana and the Psychedelic Amphetamines.\" The\nmemorable story of meeting the chief of the Swedish equivalent of the\nBureau of Narcotics, and ending up playing Mozart sonatas in the attic\nof his home, has been spun out elsewhere in the book.\n\n\nThe original concept was a grand plan to imitate two of the three\nrings of tetrahydrocannabinol.  There is an aromatic ring (with an\nalkyl group and two oxygens on it) and it is fused to a pyran ring\nwith a couple of methyl groups on it.  So, if one were to tie the\nmethyl group at the 4-position of DOM around with a short carbon chain\ninto the oxygen atom at the five position, one could squint and say\nthat the resulting amphetamine was kinda something like an analogue of\nTHC.  Thus, the resulting six-membered ring (a pyran) or five-membered\nring (a furan) could be peppered with methyl groups at different\nlocations (and up to two per location).  If the ring was a\nfive-membered structure, then the parent system would be a benzofuran,\nand the location of methyl groups on the ring would be indicated by\nthe appropriate numbers following the letter RFS which would stand for\n\"furan\".  And if it were to be a six-membered ring, the resulting\nbenzopyran would be indicated with a RPS for pyran, and again the\nmethyl group or groups would be indicated by the substitution\nposition.  This code would cover all polymethylated homologues with\ncodes that would look like F-22 and P-2234.  If any of them showed up\nwith fascinating activities, I would extend methyls to ethyls, and\nwork out some whole new naming code at some future time.  An early\nsystem, naming this compound 2-M for a methyl group on the 2-position\nof the furan ring, was abandoned when it became apparent that the\npyran world would screw everything up.\n\n\nThe isolation of characterizable quantities of\n7-formyl-5-methoxy-2-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran from the\nbenzaldehyde recipe above gave a fleeting fantasy of a whole new\ndirection that this little project might go.  If this unexpected\nbenzaldehyde were to be converted to the corresponding amphetamine,\none would have\n7-(2-aminopropyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.  Suddenly\nhere would be a 2,3,5-trisubstituted thing with a ring at the\n2,3-position, similar to the still unmade MMDA-4.  The temptation to\nbe diverted in this way lasted, fortunately, only a few minutes, and\nthe project was shelved.  Someday, when there are buckets of spare\ntime or hosts of eager graduate students, some fascinating chemistry\nmight lie this way, and maybe some fascinating pharmacology, even.\n\n\nThe plain furan analogue, without any methyl groups on it, has been\nmade.  Five-methoxybenzofuran formed the 6-formyl derivative (the\naldehyde) with a mp of 79-80 °C and from it the nitrostyrene (orange\nneedles, mp 89-91 °C) and the final amphetamine (white solids, as the\nmethane sulfonate, mp 141-144 °C) were prepared in a manner similar to\nthe preparation of F-2 above.  In the rat studies, it was three times\nmore potent than F-2, but still some 15 times less potent than DOM.\nAnd in initial human trials (of up to 30 milligrams) there were again\nno effects noted.  Naming of this material is easy chemically\n(6-(2-aminopropyl)-5-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran) but tricky as to\ncode.  If the numbers that follow the RFS give the location of the\nmethyl groups, then this material, without any such groups, can have\nno numbers following, and should properly be simply \"F.\" OK, it is\n\"F.\" The preparation or the attempted preparations of other homologues\nsuch as F-23 and F-233 are outlined under the recipe for F-22.",

The\nprefix for the simplest, the one carbon organic radical, is methyl.\nThis is from the Greek word \"methy\" and represents wine from wood.\nSuch is, indeed, methyl alcohol, or methanol, or wood alcohol, the\nsimplest one-carbon drink and a rather dangerous one for the human\nanimal.  And this is the group that is on the central oxygen of\nmescaline.\n\n\nIt is customary to refer to homologs (bigger-by-one) of methanol by\ntheir classical chemical names, so the natural extension of methyl is\nethyl, and that of mescaline would be escaline.  One carbon-chain on\nthe 4-position oxygen becoming a two-carbon chain.  This is all\nentymologically appealing, but there is no botanical support for any\nof it.  The ethyl group is much more rare in nature.  It is just a\nhappy coincidence that mescaline (the plant), and methyl (the alkyl\ngroup involved), and methoxy (the group on the 4-position of the\naromatic ring) all happen to start with the letter RMS.\n\n\nVery few of the homomescaline phenethylamines have been synthesized as\ntheir three-carbon chain counterparts, the corresponding analogues of\namphetamine.  And only three of them have been explored in man (four,\nif you count the amphetamine analogue of mescaline itself, TMA).  The\nobvious names for these compounds have, unfortunately, already been\nused.  It would be logical to use the letter M for a methoxy, and the\nletter E for ethoxy, etc. and simply read the groups from around the\nring.  But this is the naming system for the 2,4,5-trisubstituted\namphetamines.  MEM is, for example, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyamphetamine\n(in sequence, methoxy, ethoxy, methoxy reading around the ring, and a\nfascinating compound talked about at length in this book), so this\nterm cannot represent 3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyamphetamine.\n\n\nA truly simple code employs the length of the carbon chain.  The\nphenethylamine chain is two carbons long, and the amphetamine chain is\nthree carbons long.\n\n\nIf a drug has been initially developed (and initially named) as an\namphetamine derivative (three carbon chain) then the two-carbon chain\nanalogue will use the original name (or a symbolic part of it) with\nthe term 2C ahead of it.  The two-carbon analogue of DOB (a\nthree-carbon chain compound) will become 2C-B.  DOI becomes 2C-I, DON\nbecomes 2C-N, and DOET becomes 2C-E.  Each of these is a substituted\namphetamine derivative lacking one carbon atom, thus becoming a\nphenethylamine derivative.  Most of these have 2,4,5-substitution\npatterns.\n\n\nAnd if a drug has been initially developed (and initially named) as a\nphenethylamine derivative (two carbon chain) then the three-carbon\nchain analogue will use the original name with the term 3C ahead of\nit.  The three carbon analogue of E (escaline, a two-carbon chain\ncompound) will become 3C-E.  P becomes 3C-P and CPM becomes 3C-CPM.\nMost of these have 3,4,5-substitution patterns.\n\n\nThus, R2-CS implies that a known amphetamine drug has been shortened\nto a phenethylamine, and R3-CS inplies that a known phenethylamine has\nbeen lengthened to an amphetamine.  A great number of the former have\nbeen made and have proven to be most rewarding.  Only a few of the\nlatter are known, but most of them will eventually prove to be potent\npsychedelics.",

    title: "DOPR", 
    category: Category.find_by!(title: "Elixers"), 
    description: "There is a thread of disconnection and of\ninconsistent reference that pervades most of the reports that I have\nreceived concerning the use of DOPR.  The word that comes to mind is\nhypnogogic.  There is a drifting into that place that lies between a\nnot-quite-awake and a not-quite-asleep state seems to characterize\nthis compound.  There is no question but that it is very potent, and\nthat it is very long-lived.  But there is a nagging suggestion of the\nout-of-body, out-of-center character that is the hallmark of the\nanesthetic and delusional drugs such as scopolamine or ketamine.  With\nthem, the psychedelic effects become clouded with touches of amnesia.\nIf DOPR shows this with it's three carbon alkyl group, thereis every\nreason to pay close attention as the chain becomes longer.\n\n\nThere had been quite a bit of speculation in the literature that the\nmetabolic attack on DOM was at the 4-position, and this was an\noxidation process.  In a moment of inspiration, I decided to explore a\nsimilar oxidation step in DOPR, since it is probably the most potent\nof the DO-series.  Why not make the compound which would be the first\nstep in this oxidation, the 1-hydroxypropyl analogue?  This I did, by\nusing the phthalimide derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine\n(described in the synthesis of DOI) and making the propiophenone using\npropionic acid as both reagent and solvent, and polyphosphoric acid as\nthe condensing agent.  The ketone product (a white crystalline solid\nfrom methanol) was dissolved in warm methanol and reduced to the\nalcohol with sodium borohydride.  This product, also a white\ncrystalline solid, was stripped of the phthalimide blocking group with\novernight refluxing with hydrazine in ethanol.  The product,\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(1-hydroxypropyl)-amphetamine (hydroxy-DOPR) had a mp\nof 148-150 °C from IPA.  Its activity is not yet known, but there were\nno effects at all at trials, orally, of up to 200 micrograms.\n\n\nBut this is all with the normal-propyl compound.  There is a rich\ncollection of misinformation and potential discovery that is\nassociated with the isopropyl isomer.  This structural isomer,\n2,5-dimethoxyl-4-(i)-propylamphetamine is properly called DOIP for\ndes-oxy-iso-propyl.  It has been synthesized and explored in animals\nand, to a modest extent, in man.  The synthesis has proceeded from\n2,5-dimethoxyacetophenone by the addition of a methyl group to the\ncarbonyl followed by reduction to the hydrocarbon.  Aldehyde\nformation, nitropropene synthesis with nitroethane, and lithium\naluminum hydride reduction are uneventful, providing the hydrochloride\nsalt DOIP, which has a mp of 183-184 °C as an analytical sample.\nAnimal tests (such as rabbit hyperthermia assays), have indicated that\nthe isopropyl compound DOIP is less potent than the propyl prototype,\nDOPR, by between one and two orders of magnitude.  In man, a dose of\nfour milligrams, a rousing dose of DOPR, is without any effects.  At\n10 milligrams, there is some disturbance but substantially no effects.\nI have been told that with doses in the 20 to 30 milligram range there\nare valid changes in mental state, but I have not been told the nature\nof these changes.\n\n\nA fascinating red herring had been drawn across all of these exacting\nlines by a strange visitor to this research project.  An olive-faced\nM.D., Ph.D., passed through this confusing scene briefly, and when he\nleft, a small supply of DOPR left with him.  He promptly published in\nan obscure journal some animal behavioral responses which he ascribed\nto the isopropyl analogue, DOIP.  But what he had studied could only\nhave been DOPR since DOIP, at that time, had not yet been synthesized\neither by me, or by either of the other two active synthesists of that\nmoment.  It was not yet a known material.  We all made it some time\nlater, but by that time our olive-face had disappeared.  There is a\nmagnificent French phrase that applies here as nowhere else; Il a\nfoutu le camp.  Its idiomatic meaning is equivalent to our, \"He took\noff,\" or \"He split the scene,\" but the literal translation is, \"He\nfucked the camp.\"",

    description: "I can't remember the exact names of the\ncompanies that went with the oil additives.  STP was, I believe, it's\nown thing, and originally stood for Scientifically Treated Petroleum.\nAnd F-310 was, I believe, a Chevron Oil product.  F-320 was, of\ncourse, the product of the wild and happy chemists at the\nPharmaceutical Chemistry Department at the University of California in\nSan Francisco, playing with what they fondly called \"funny drugs.\" And\nwhen the 2,4,6-orientation became an obvious positional isomer, the\nPennzoil Oil Company's additive, Z-7, was a natural to have its name\nvolunteered to the cause.  There was one additional isomer possible,\nwith the methyl in the 2-position and the methoxyl groups at the 4-\nand 6-positions.  This followed the more conventional aldehyde made\nfrom 3,5-dimethoxytoluene via the Vilsmeier process, with POCl3 and\nN-methylformanilide.  This material\n(2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylbenzaldehyde with mp 64-65 °C from cyclohexane\nor from MeOH) is completely distinct from the isomer used above\n(2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde with a mp of 92-93 °C from MeOH).\nThe amphetamine from this isomer is 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylamphetamine,\nand had been christened by the chemistry crowd as Z-7.1.\n\n\nMuch effort had been put forth in research by this medical school\ngroup of graduate students and graduate advisors, to try to explain\nthe biological activity of the 2,4,5-things such as TMA-2 and DOM\n(STP).  And a considerable investment had been made in the attempt to\ntie together the amphetamine world of psychedelics with the indole\nworld of psychedelics.  The convenience of having two methoxy groups\npara to one another was a clear invitation to speculate upon the\nformation of a benzoquinone intermediate of some kind, and this would\nrequire the loss of the methyl groups which were already known to be\nmetabolically labile.  This \"quinone-like\" intermediate was the\ncornerstone of a \"hydroquinone hypothesis,\" as it allowed further\ncondensation within the molecule itself involving the primary amine\ngroup, to form something called an indolene which, with some arcane\nelectron pushing and removal, could eventually become an indole.\nThere.  We now have a tie-in to the tryptamine world, and to\nserotonin, and that entire neurotransmitter magic.\n\n\nThere was only one small fly in the ointment.  No matter how the\n2,4,5-things were explained, none of the proposed mechanisms could\nallow for the 2,4,6-things to also be active.\n\n\nHow can one accommodate such blasphemy?  The first and obvious\napproach was the simplest.  Denial.  The 2,4,6-things aren't really\nactive at all.  Placebo stuff.  There is a commonly used phrase, \"bad\nscience\" which is an in-famous term used to belittle findings that do\nnot fit with one's theories or purposes.  But that simply didn't wash,\nbecause I knew, as did a few others who chose not to identify\nthemselves too publicly, that TMA-2 and TMA-6 were both fully active\nin the 40 to 50 milligram area.  And although not as potent as DOM,\nthe compound of this recipe, psi-DOM or Z-7, was certainly an active\none.  So, since approach number one didn't work, try approach number\ntwo.  Make the shoe fit the wearer, without respect to the size of his\nfoot.  One single size shoe fits all.  One single mechanistic\nhypothesis explains all.  It was obvious that for the \"hydroquinone\"\nhypothesis to survive, Z-7 would have to undergo some metabolic\noxidation--phenol formation--in the 3-position.\n\n\nAnd guess who was actually euchred into embarking onto the synthesis\nof this hypothetical metabolic Lucy [that's the anthropological-type,\nnot the LSD-type Lucy]?  Moi!  On to a new methoxylated amphetamine\nwhich would be called Z-7.2.  Oxidation of the above\n2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylbenzaldehyde with metachloroperoxybenzoic acid\ngave 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylphenol which smoothly methylated (KOH,\nCH3I) to give 2,3,5-trimethoxytoluene as a white oil, bp 59-62 °C at\n0.1 mm/Hg.  This formed the anion between the meta-methoxy groups with\nbutyllithium, and N-methylformanilide gave the new compound\n2,3,6-trimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde, also an oil (bp 130-140 °C at\n0.7 mm/Hg) with an excellent NMR spectrum.  This formed the 3-carbon\nnitrostyrene with nitroethane, as bright yellow crystals from methanol\nwith a mp 67-68.5 °C (and excellent NMR and microanalysis, C,H,N).\nLithium aluminum hydride reduction gave rise to what I was assuming\nwould be the target amphetamine, 4-methyl-2,3,6-trimethoxyamphetamine\nor Z-7.2.  This formed a hydrochloride salt which, although\nanalytically excellent, insisted in remaining as an ether and\nchloroform-soluble oil which had an excellent NMR spectrum.  This was\ncertainly MY target compound, but it was not THEIR target compound.\nThe upper echelons who were running the show were serious about this\nhydroquinone thing.  Therefore, this product Z-7.2, that should have\nbeen entered into human evaluation, was instead processed further by\nthe substitution of a t-BOC on the amine group, oxidation to the\nquinone with ceric ammonium nitrate, reduction to the hydroquinone\nwith dithionite, and finally deprotection of the blocking t-BOC group\nby hydrochloric acid.  The final product,\n2,5-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-4-methylamphetamine hydrochloride, was an\nextremely light-sensitive solid which was looked at by NMR (excellent\nspectrum in D2O) and by cyclic voltimetry (destructive and\nuninformative) but which would have been totally worthless to have\ntasted.\n\n\nIn fact, the whole 2,4,6 substitution concept is just now beginning to\nexplode.  Fully half of the drugs described in this Book II are of the\nclassical 2,4,5-trisubstitution pattern, and it is becoming evident\nthat every one of them will have a 2,4,6-trisubstituted counterpart\nthat bids fair to be an active psychedelic.  Diligence could thus\neasily double the number of known psychedelics.  The nickname \"pseudo\"\nis really the Greek letter \"psi\" which looks like a candelabrum\nstanding on the table holding up three candles.  If I can find the\ntype in some font, I will simply precede each known drug with this\nletter, to indicate that the 2,4,5-ness has become a 2,4,6-ness.\nTherefore, Z-7 is also pseudo-DOM.\n\n\nZ-7.2 might have been an interesting compound to taste.  But the\nacademic climate was not appropriate at that time (early 1977) for\nsuch honesty.  The \"hydro-quinone hypothesis\" is now not much more\nthan a minor bit of history.  And anyhow, it was just about this time\nthat I had uncovered a slick way of getting a sulfur atom into the\namphetamine molecule.  I quickly lost interest in the pursuit of other\npeople's hypotheses that didn't seem to lead anywhere.  Maybe,\nsomeday, some single earth-shaking mechanism will emerge to explain\neverything.  But in the meantime, the best contribution I can make to\nthis \"grand unified theory of psychedelic activity\" is to continue to\nmake new and unexpected things which, if they are active, will\neffectively destroy any hypothesis that just happens to be popular at\nthe moment.  It is a lot more exciting, too.",

    description: "The rationale for the design and making of\nDOM has already been discussed.  One could predict that it could have\nbeen, theoretically, a totally inactive compound and maybe an\neffective blocker for whatever receptor sites are being occupied by\nother psychoactive drugs and even for strange things that some\nunbalanced people might actually make within their bodies, using their\nown personal chemistry.  On the other hand, it could have been a\npotent psychedelic in its own rights, and if so, probably long lived.\nThe latter \"could have been\" proved to be so.\n\n\nThe very modest amount of study of the individual optical isomers\nclearly indicates that the \"R\" isomer is the more active.  The sparse\ncomments suggest that some of the heavier physical aspects of the\nracemate might be due to contributions from the \"inactive\" \"S\" isomer.\nIt is, after all, the \"S\" isomer of amphetamine that carries the major\npunch of that stimulant.  Maybe if that isomer were removed, and one\nwere to explore the pure \"R\" isomer of DOM, the dramatic visual\naspects of the larger dosages might not be complicated with a\ntroublesome physical component.\n\n\nThis compound, unbeknownst to me, was scattered widely and plentifully\nin the heyday of the Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, in mid-1967.  It\nwas distributed under the name STP, which was said to stand for\nSerenity, Tranquility, and Peace.  It was also claimed to represent\nSuper Terrific Psychedelic, or Stop The Police.  The police called it:\nToo Stupid to Puke.  Actually, the name was taken from the initials of\na motor additive which was completely unrelated chemically.\nIncredibly, and sadly, one of the avowed experts in the area of the\n\"sensuous drugs\" actually stated that STP, the motor oil additive, was\nreally one and the same as STP, the highly dangerous psychedelic.  The\nmotor oil additive, he wrote in a book of his, had properties somewhat\nrelated to those of LSD, mescaline, and the amphetamines.  How\nfortunate that the love children of the time didn't do much reading,\nfor they might have gotten into yet deeper pharmacological troubles\nwith drug raids on the local gasoline stations.\n\n\nTwo complications became apparent during this first appearance and\nthey led to serious difficulties.  One, there was no equation made\nbetween STP and DOM.  No one knew what this drug was which had been\ndistributed in a cavalier way throughout the city.  There could be no\neducated guess as to the best treatment of overdose emergencies.  And\nsecondly, the initial tablets that had been distributed apparently\ncontained 20 milligrams of DOM per tablet; later, it was dropped to 10\nmilligrams.  Either of these, in retrospect, is now known to be a\nthoroughly whopping dose.  The overdose situation was aggravated by\nthe slow onset of DOM.  The user may be aware of some initial effects\nat the half-hour point, there will be what might be called a + or ++\nat the end of the first hour, and the full impact of the drug is not\nappreciated until some two hours have elapsed.  But many of the\nrecipients of the free handouts of DOM were familiar with LSD which\ncan show its alert in 15 to 20 minutes, or even sooner with a large\ndose, and there is already a deep and compelling intoxication felt at\nthe half-hour point.  They, quite reasonably, expected this familiar\nactivity pattern with STP and assumed, when there was little if any\nactivity noted at the half-hour point, that the potency was less than\nexpected.  They took one or even two additional dosage units.  Thus,\nsome of the overdose victims of that period may well have taken as\nmuch as 30 mg of DOM.  The slow onset of action, coupled with the\nremarkably long duration, caught many innocent users unprepared.\n\n\nClinical studies have documented the rapid tolerance development from\nrepeated exposures to DOM.  Five volunteers were given 6 milligrams\ndaily for three days.  Objectively, psychological tests showed a\ndecrease in responses.  Subjectively, all found extremely intense\neffects on the first day, and all but one found it unpleasant.  By the\nthird exposure on the third day, all had diminished responses, ranging\nfrom only \"moderately strong\" to \"felt absolutely nothing.\" One\nactually slept during the experience on the third day.\n\n\nThe hexadeutero-analogue (deuterium atoms on the two methoxyl groups)\nhas been prepared as an internal standard for analytical work, but\nthere are no reports of its human pharmacology.  A study with this\nsort of derivative would be a fine companion to the studies already\nunderway with the mescaline analogues that are similarly substituted.\nA difference exists, however.  With mescaline, it is believed that the\nloss of a methoxyl group is a step towards the inactivation of the\ncompound, whereas with DOM this loss may be associated with the\nformation of an active metabolite.  The several fascinating questions\nraised by possible differences in both the rates and the degree of\ndemethylation of these two compounds are well worth trying to answer.\n\n\nA number of compounds related to DOM had been synthesized and studied\nat the University of California at San Francisco, at about this time.\nTwo of these were simply the juggling of the two methoxyl groups and\nthe methyl group on the ring, still maintaining the 2,4,5-ness\nrelative to the amphetamine chain.  These are\n2,4-dimethoxy-5-methylamphetamine and\n4,5-dimethoxy-2-methylamphetamine.  Since the slang name for DOM in\nand about the medical center was STP, and since STP was the name of a\nmotor oil additive, it is not unreasonable that the first of these to\nbe synthesized, the 2,4-dimethoxy-5-methyl isomer, was referred to by\nthe name of another motor oil additive popular at that time, F-310.\nThe Vilsmeier reaction between 2,4-dimethoxytoluene and the Vilsmeier\ncomplex of POCl3 and N-methylformanilide gave the benzaldehyde (mp\n117-118 °C) with a yellow malononitrile derivative from EtOH with a mp\nof 193-194 °C.  The nitrostyrene from this and nitroethane formed\nyellow crystals from CH3CN, with a mp 138-139 °C.  The amine formed\neasily with LAH in ether, and the product F-310 (or 5-DOM) gave white\ncrystals from CH3CN with a mp of 182-183 °C.\n\n\nAnd the other isomer, the 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl counterpart, became\nknown familiarly as F-320, or sometimes simply 2-DOM.  Its preparation\nfollowed an identical procedure, starting from 3,4-dimethoxytoluene.\nI have been told that F-310 is not active even at 20 milligrams in\nman, which would make it several times less potent than DOM (STP).  I\nknow of no trials with F-320.  The use of the letter RFS does not\nimply any relationship between these two compounds and the series\ndescribed elsewhere with the RFS code followed by other numbers, such\nas F-2 and F-22.  These latter are F's because they are furans, not\nmotor oil additives.  And yet another oil additive, well known at the\ntime as Z-7, became associated with the synthesis of the DOM (STP)\nisomer with its groups in the 2,4,6-positions.  This is entered\nseparately under gamma-DOM.",

    description: "Again, as with every other psychedelic\namphetamine analogue which has a chiral center and has been explored\nas the individual optical isomers, it is the \"R\" isomer that is the\nmore potent.  And again, the other isomer, the \"S\" isomer, still shows\nsome activity.  The same was true with DOB, and DOM, and MDA.  The\nonly exception was MDMA, but then that is more of a stimulant, and\nthere is virtually no psychedelic component to its action.  Rat\nstudies, where there is a measure of the discrimination of a test\ncompound from saline, have shown the \"R\" isomer to have about twice\nthe potency of the \"S\" isomer.  That the \"R\" is more potent is\ncertain, but the above reports would suggest that the factor would be\ncloser to times-four rather than times-two.\n\n\nA number of studies with DOI in animal models have shown it to have an\nextremely high binding capacity to what are called the 5-HT2\nreceptors.  Serotonin is a vital neurotransmitter in the brain, and is\nstrongly implicated in the action of all of the phenethylamine\npsychedelics.  The place where it acts, at the molecular level, is\ncalled its receptor site.  As an outgrowth of the cooperative studies\nof the medicinal chemists working closely with the\nneuropharmacologists, a number of compounds have emerged that interact\nwith these sites.  But this one interacts with these sites and not\nthose, and that one interacts with those sites and not these.  So,\nthere has developed a collection of sub-divisions and sub-subdivisions\nof receptor sites, all related to serotonin, but each defined by the\nparticular compound that interacts most tightly with it.\n\n\nThus, there were serotonin \"1\" receptors, and then there were \"1\" and\n\"2\" receptors, and then \"1a\" and \"1b\" and \"2a\" and \"2b\" receptors, and\non and on.  These are called 5-HT receptors, since the chemical name\nfor serotonin is 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the scientist would never\nwant to let the layman know just what he is talking about.  DOI has\nbeen synthesized with a variety of radioactive iodine isotopes in it,\nand these tools have been of considerable value in mapping out its\nbrain distribution.  And by extrapolation, the possible localization\nof other psychedelic compounds that cannot be so easily labelled.  A\nsmall neurochemical research company on the East Coast picked up on\nthese properties of DOI, and offered it as a commercial item for\nresearch experiments.  But I doubt that they are completely innocent\nof the fact that DOI is an extremely potent psychedelic and that it is\nstill unrecognized by the Federal drug laws since, in their most\nrecent catalog, the price had almost doubled and a note had been added\nto the effect that telephone orders cannot be accepted for this\ncompound.\n\n\nThe four-carbon butylamine homologue (the ARIADNE analogue) of DOI has\nbeen synthesized.  A mixture of the free base of\n1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane (see preparation under DOB) and\nphthalic anhydride was fused, cooled, and recrystallized from either\nmethanol or cyclohexane to give crystals of\nN-phthalimide with a melting point of\n76-77 °C and an analysis (C20H21NO4) C,H,N.  This was iodinated with\niodine monochloride in acetic acid to give\nN-phthalimide which was\nchromatographically distinct from the uniodinated starting material\n(silica gel, CH2Cl2 ), but which did not crystallize.  This was\ntreated with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to provide\n1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminobutane hydrochloride which was\ncrystallized from CH3CN/EtOH to give white crystals with a mp of\n217-218.5 °C and an analysis (C12H19CINO2) C,H,N.  This butyl homolog\nof DOI has been assayed at up to four milligrams, and is without any\ncentral effects whatsoever.  An experiment with 12.4 microcuries of\n131I labelled material with the whole body scanner showed most of it\naccumulating in the gut and liver, with almost none to the brain.\n\n\nFor those who find such statistics interesting, the parent compound\nDOI vies with DOB as probably the most potent of the phenethylamine\npsychedelics as of the moment, and certainly one of the most long\nlived.\n\n\nA very important, centrally pivotal, and completely paradoxical\ncompound in this area, is the N,N-dimethyl homologue of DOI, or\n2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethyl-4-iodoamphetamine (IDNNA).  This compound\nwas the starting point of the study of a large number of homologues\nand it deserves, and has received, a separate recipe.",

    description: "The original code for this compound was\nDOE, which was completely logical based on DOM being the methyl member\nof this series (DO for the removal of the oxygen, desoxy, and M for\nputting a methyl in its place).  And the putting of the ethyl thence\nshould be DOE.  This was fine until it was pointed out to me by a\nclose colleague that DOE was a classic abbreviation for\ndesoxyephedrine, a synonym for methamphetamine.  The pressure to add\nthe RTS of the RETS of the ethyl was heightened by looking ahead to\nother members of the series.  DOA became DOAM, DOE became DOET, but\nDOM was already too firmly set in popular usage.  And, anyway, DOME\nreally looked strange.\n\n\nThe original publications of the action of DOM clearly documented the\ncompound as being a psychedelic and one with a sizeable measure of\npotential abuse.  And, it is not a surprise that it was quickly\nshuffled into a legal classification that effectively precluded any\nfurther study of it.  So, when this immediate homologue of DOM was\nstudied and discussed in the literature, all reported dosages were\nthose that were at the lowest levels, and no disturbing hints of\nabusability were mentioned.  And this particular homologue has so far\nescaped the attention and restrictive action of the drug enforcement\nagencies, although the specific wording of the Controlled Substance\nAnalogue Enforcement Act of 1986 might make this point moot, at least\nas far as human trials are concerned.  At modest levels, DOET has the\nreputation of being a cognitive enhancer and is largely free of those\nsensory distortions that would catch the attention of the authorities\nwho cannot tolerate drugs that distort the senses.  The higher levels\nmentioned here have never been put into the published literature.  It\nmust be noted that there is a considerable variation of individual\nresponses to this material.

It wasn't the sort of thing that someone would just happen to\ndo.  If there were a rationale, then that's fine.  But by capricious\nimpulse, no.  But there is a rationale of sorts, which I just hinted\nat in the discussion under 2C-T-21.\n\n\nThis argument of reason goes as follows.  Assume that I would like to\nput a fluorine atom into a drug that does not normally have one.  Why\nwould I want to?  Because I want to have the molecule carry a\nradioactive fluorine atom into some inner recess of the brain.  Why?\nBecause by using a positron-emitting fluorine I could possibly\nvisualize the area of the brain that the drug went to.  And if it went\nthere in some abnormal way, the exact measure of that abnormality\nmight give some clue as to potential brain misfunctioning.\n\n\nBut, if you put a fluorine atom on a drug, it becomes a totally new\ndrug and, quite reasonably, a pharmacologically different drug.\nHowever, a body of evidence is being accumulated that if a halogen,\nsuch as a bromine or an iodine atom, is replaced by a beta-fluoroethyl\ngroup, the electronic and polar properties of the drug can be pretty\nmuch the same.  So, what psychedelics have a bromo or an iodo group?\nObviously, DOB and DOI.  Thus, DOEF is a natural candidate for\nfluorine-18 positron emission tomography, and also a natural candidate\nfor clinical trials.  And, voila, it is an active material.\n\n\nAnd I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts, that if one were to make the\ntwo-carbon analog 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethyl)-phenethylamine, it\nwould be every bit as much a treasure and ally as is 2C-B or 2C-I.  In\nfact, I am sure enough about this prediction that I am willing to name\nthe stuff 2C-EF.  It will be easily made from 2C-B by the same\nreaction scheme that was used above for DOEF.

The difference between the\nvarious halogen atoms was brought up under the 2C-C discussion.  DOC\nis clearly a long-lasting, dyed-in-the-wool psychedelic.\n\n\nIn the making of this, by the procedures that have been followed in\nCanada, there are two chemical intermediates which might, some day, be\nlooked at as potential psychedelics under their own colors.  Reduction\nof the compound that is called DON in this Book II\n(2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitroamphetamine hydrochloride) with Pd/charcoal and\nhydrogen, gives the 4-amino derivative.  This is\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-aminoamphetamine dihydrochloride, DOA, which melts at\n248-250 °C.  And the reduction of an oxime intermediate gives rise to\nthe acetamido analogue, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-acetamidoamphetamine\nhydrochloride, DOAA, with a mp of 249-250 °C.  Neither compound has\nbeen tasted, but someday this omission will be corrected.  DOA and\nDOAA have a sinister ring to them, however, and some changes of\nterminology might be needed.  DOA, in the coroner's vocabulary, means\nDead-On-Arrival.  But then, AMA (the American Medical Association)\njust happens to also mean (in the jargon of emergency medicine)\nAgainst-Medical-Advice.  Everything averages out, somehow.  Remember\nthat the amyl homolog (amyl at the 4-position) follows the 4-letter\nconvention of all of the DOM homo-logues, and has the code name of\nDOAM.

    description: "It is not possible to give a dosage range\nfor DOBU.  There is no question but that whatever is occurring is slow\nof onset, and very long lived.  In general, the effects resemble\nstimulation more that anything else.\n\n\nA butyl group has four carbons, and they can be interconnected in four\nways (as long as you don't connect them in rings).  If all four of\nthem are in a straight chain, you have the so-called normal butyl (or\nn-butyl) group, and this is the exact arrangement that is found in the\nDOBU.  The atoms can be numbered #1 through #4, going outwards from\nthe point of attachment.  The chain can, however, be only three\ncarbons long, and the fourth or extra carbon attached on the #2 carbon\natom; this is called the iso-butyl (or i-butyl) group.  Or the extra\nleft-over carbon can be attached to the #1 carbon atom; this is called\nthe secondary butyl (or sec-butyl or s-butyl) group.  Or lastly, the\natoms can be all scrunched up, with the chain only two carbons long,\nand the other two left-over methyl carbons attached to the #1 carbon\natom.  This isomer is called the tertiary butyl (or tert-butyl or\nt-butyl) group.  In animal studies, and in preliminary human studies,\nthe activity of these compounds drops as the butyl group gets more and\nmore scrunched.\n\n\nThe isomer with the iso-butyl group has been synthesized by the\nFriedel- Crafts reaction of isobutyryl chloride with\np-dimethoxybenzene, followed by reduction of the ketone to an alcohol,\ndehydration to a dimethylstyrene, and final hydrogenation to a\nhydrocarbon.  The formation of the benzaldehyde, reaction with\nnitroethane, and final lithium aluminum hydride reduction to\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-methylpropyl)-amphetamine hydrochloride (DOIB, mp\n164-166 °C) were completely conventional.  In drug discrimination\nstudies in rats, DOIB was only a third as active as DOM, and in humans\nthe activity falls in the 10 to 15 milligram area.  The isomer with\nthe sec-butyl group was made in a somewhat similar manner, from\n2,5-dimeth-oxyacetophenone.  The addition of ethyl magnesium bromide\ngave an alcohol which with dehydration yielded a pair of\ndimethylstyrenes isomeric to the compound mentioned above.  From there\nan identical sequence of steps (hydrogenation, benzaldehyde synthesis,\nnitrostyrene, and lithium aluminum hydride reduction) produced\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(1-methylpropyl)amphetamine hydrochloride (DOSB, mp\n168-170 °C.).  In the rat studies it was only a twelfth the potency of\nDOM, and in man the active dose is in the 25 to 30 milligram area.  As\nwith the normal butyl compound, there is a strong stimulation factor,\nwith real and long-lasting sleep disturbance.\n\n\nThe last of the butyl isomers, the tert-butyl compound, was made from\na much more obvious starting material.  This is the commercially\navailable tert-butyl hydroquinone.  It was methylated in sodium\nhydroxide with methyl iodide, and then carried through the above\nsequence (benzaldehyde. mp 124 °C from cyclohexane, nitrostyrene,\nyellow crystals from methanol, mp 95-96.5 °C, and lithium aluminum\nhydride reduction) to give\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)amphetamine hydrochloride (DOTB, mp\n168 °C).  Rats trained in a process called the Sidman Avoidance\nSchedule gave behavior that suggested that DOTB had no activity at\nall, and in human trials, doses of up to 25 milligrams were totally\nwithout effect.\n\n\nAn effort was made to prepare a butyl analogue containing a ring, but\nit was never completed.  This was the cyclopropylmethyl isomer,\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclo-propylmethylamphetamine hydrochloride, DOCPM.\nOnly the first step of its synthesis was complete (the reaction of\ncyclopropylcarboxylic acid chloride with p-dimethoxybenzene) and even\nit went badly.  The desired ketone (2,5-dimethoxyphenyl cyclopropyl\nketone) was most difficult to separate from the recovered starting\nether.  A promising approach would be the isolation of the phenol\n(2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl cyclopropyl ketone) which is a beautiful\nyellow solid with a melting point of 99-100 °C from methanol.  Anal.\n(C11H12O3) C,H.  It then could be methylated to the wanted\nintermediate.  It is the major product when the reaction is conducted\nwith anhydrous aluminum chloride in methylene chloride.\n\n\nThe 2-carbon phenethylamine homologues of these compounds could all,\nin principle be easily made by using nitromethane instead of\nnitroethane with the intermediary benzaldehydes.  But, as of the\npresent time, none of them have been made, so their pharmacology\nremains completely unknown.",

    description: "The stars had clearly lined up in favor of\nmaking DOB and exploring its biological activity.  This preparation\nhad been completed in 1967 and the report of this compound and its\nunprecedently high potency published in 1971.  And very shortly, two\nadditional papers appeared completely independently.  One described\nDOB made via a different route, and describing high activity in rats.\nThe other described DOB and a couple of closely related brominated\namphetamines and their action in man.\n\n\nThis is one of the last of the experimental compounds within the\nphenethylamine family on which any animal toxicity studies were\nperformed by me prior to human studies.  A mouse injected with 50\nmg/Kg (ip) showed considerable twitching and was irritable.  Another,\nat 100 mg/Kg (ip), had overt shaking at 20 minutes, which evolved into\npersistent hyperactivity that lasted several hours.  Yet another, at\n125 mg/Kg (ip), lost much of her righting reflex within 15 minutes,\nentered into convulsions at 50 minutes, and was dead a half hour\nlater.  A fourth mouse, at 150 mg/Kg (ip), entered into spontaneous\nconvulsions within 10 minutes, and expired in what looked like an\nuncomfortable death at 22 minutes following injection.  What was\nlearned?  That the LD/50 was somewhere between 100 and 125 mg/Kg for\nthe mouse.  And an effective dose in man of maybe 2 mg (for an 80 Kg\nman) is equivalent to 25 ug/Kg.  Therefore the index of safety (the\ntherapeutic index, the lethal dose divided by the effective dose) is\nwell over a thousand.  I feel that two mice were killed without\nanything of value having been received in return.\n\n\nActually, it is very likely that the damaging, if not lethal, level of\nDOB in man is a lot lower than this ratio would imply.  There was a\nreport of a death of a young lady following the snorting of an amount\nof DOB so massive, there was the actual recovery of over nine\nmilligrams of the drug from her body tissues in the post-mortem\nexamination.  It was said that she and her companion had thought that\nthe drug they were using was MDA and, taking a dosage appropriate for\nthis, effectively overdosed themselves.  He survived, following\nconvulsions and an extended period (several weeks) of being in a\ncomatose state.  Tragic examples have been reported that involve\narterial vascular spasm.  But in most overdose cases ascribed to DOB,\nthe identity of the drug has remained unestablished.\n\n\nAs with DOI, the presence of a heavy atom, the bromine atom, in DOB\nmakes the radioactive isotope labelled material a powerful research\ntool.  Studies with DOB labelled with either 82Br or 77Br have been\nused in human subjects to follow the distribution of the drug.  The\nuse of a whole body scanner permits the imaging of the intact body,\nwith the travelings of the radioactivity easily followed from outside.\nA fascinating finding is that DOB goes first and foremost to the human\nlung where it accumulates for a couple of hours.  It is only\nafterwards that the brain level builds up.  There is a strong\nimplication that some metabolic conversion occurs in the lung, and it\nis only after this that the truly active metabolite is available for\ncentral action.  This is consistent with the relatively slow onset of\neffect, and the very long duration of action.\n\n\nAs with all the other psychedelics which can and have been studied as\ntheir optical isomers, it is the \"R\" isomer of DOB that is the more\nactive than the racemic mixture, and the \"S\" is certainly much less\nactive, but it has never been run up to fully active levels.  The\nalpha-ethyl homologue of DOB is mentioned under ARIADNE.  The\npositionally rearranged isomers of DOB are discussed under META-DOB.",

The process described above is just a bit\nbizarre (a sulfate salt extracting into methylene chloride) but it was\nthe actual thing that was done.  The work was started towards two\nadditional compounds but these never got past the first \"ketone and\nphenol\" stage.  p-Dimethoxybenzene was brought into reaction with\nn-caproic acid with polyphosphoric acid (aiming towards\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-hexylamphetamine, DOHE) but this was dropped when\nDOAM proved to be down in potency.

    description: "Why all the interest?  Why keep pursuing a\ncompound that is so obviously without activity?  Or a metabolite that\nis also without activity?  The answer is that these are totally\nfascinating compounds just because they have no activity!  By the way,\nin this instance, I actually made up most of the quotations.  I am not\nsure that the subjects actually said, \"Nothing,\" but they did report\nthat there were no effects.  In my own experiments, my notes record\nthe phrase, \"No effects whatsoever.\"\n\n\nA little background: one of the transmitter heavyweights in the brain\nis dopamine.  Dopamine is called dopamine because it is an amine that\ncomes from an amino acid that is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and this,\nin German, is Di-Oxo-Phenyl-Alanine, or DOPA.  The levo-optical (or\nL-) isomer of DOPA has rather cutely been called the punch-drunk\nSpanish matador, or El Dopa.  But that is not part of the story.\n\n\nThe story is really about the \"Pink Spot of Schizophrenia.\" Many years\nago, an observation was made in a biochemical laboratory on the East\nCoast that stirred up a rolling controversy.  It had been found that\nif the urines of schizophrenic patients (sloppily called\n\"schizophrenic urines\") were extracted in such and such a way, and the\nextracts chromatographed, a pink spot would develop at a particular\nplace on the chromatogram.  Well, if this proved to be true with\nurines of a sick population, and were this proved to be different from\nthe urines of a healthy population, it would constitute an objective\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia.  A simple chemical test to confirm a\npathology that had defied all efforts to achieve consensus amongst the\npsychiatrists of the world.\n\n\nThe literature was suddenly filled with dozens of papers.  Researcher\nA confirmed that the pink spot was found with schizophrenics, and not\nwith normal controls.  Researcher B found the pink spot in all urines,\nregardless of pathology.  Researcher C found it in no urines at all.\nResearcher D argued that it was a factor from the hospital diet.\nResearcher E found that the pink spot reflected the time of day that\nthe urine sample was collected.  Researcher F drew a conclusion about\nwhere truth might lie by tallying the number of papers that supported\nargument A, B, C, D, or E.\n\n\nThe only confirmable fact that endured was that the pink spot was due\nto DMPEA.  So a bright spotlight was directed towards its possible\nrole in mental illness.  And this expressed itself in the simple\nquestion: would it produce schizophrenia in a normal subject?  No.\nAnd in a way I am comforted that that did not evolve into a simple\nlitmus test for a schizophrenic diagnosis.  There are so many\ncultural, political, and social factors that come to bear on the\nassignment of a diagnosis of mental illness, that I would have been\nforever skeptical of a neat biochemical marker.\n\n\nA chemical modification of DMPEA that has been explored in this\nquestion of pink spots, mental pathology, and diagnostic markers, is\nthe corresponding acetamide.  One of the metabolites of DMPEA was\nfound to be the N-acetyl deriva-tive, N-acetyl-3,4-\ndimethoxyphenethylamine.  It was found to be demethylated in man, and\nto have pharmacological activity in animals.  Maybe this was the\nactive compound that could be involved in the schizophrenic process.\nBut human trials with it, as with the principal metabolite\n3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid, showed nothing at all in man.\n\n\nAnother chemical modification is the beta-hydroxy analogue of DMPEA.\nIt has been explored separately, and is the subject of its own recipe,\nin its own rights.  See DME.\n\n\nPink was not the only colorful spot associated with schizophrenia.\nSomewhere at about this same time, a research paper from Canada\nreported the observation of a mauve spot in the chromatographic\nanalysis of urines of schizophrenic patients.  This had nothing to do\nwith DMPEA.  I was working closely with a researcher at the\npsychiatric institute and we were fascinated by, again, a possible\ndiagnostic marker.  We assayed the urines of the next 10 patients\nbeing admitted as acute schizophrenics.  No trace of mauve.  We wrote\nto Canada, and verified the analytical procedure.  We were told that\nthe whatzis should have been added after, rather than before, the\nwhosey, and that we should have heated for 30, not 10 minutes.  Okay.\nWe assayed the urines of the next 10 patients being admitted using\nthese new directions.  No trace of mauve.  Another call to Canada, and\nwe were informed that we still weren't doing it right.  They were\nconsistently batting a 100% positive correlation between mauve spots\nand schizophrenics, and 0% with healthy controls.  In fact, they\nactually gave this positive test the name of a disease, Malvaria.\n\n\nThen, that little burst of insight!  Aha!  What if, just what if, they\nhad been seeing something given to their schizophrenics?\nChlorpromazine was the popular treatment of the day.  We took a\nwhopping dose of chlorpromazine, and over the next couple of days did\nmanage (barely) to collect our urine samples.  Both of us were\npositive Malvarians!  And three days later, we were again negative.\nWe were most likely seeing a metabolite of chlorpromazine.  One last\ncall to Canada with the ultimate question--had you given any\nmedication to your schizophrenics before your urine analysis?  Of\ncourse (came the answer)--it would not be ethical to leave them\nuntreated.  Another color down the drain, and still no objective\nmeasure for mental illness.\n\n\nBy the way, I cannot say I like the chlorpromazine trip.  There is no\nreal communication either with others or with yourself, with that\nstuff.  You are a zombie, but if you are both schizophrenic and a\nzombie, you cannot possibly be troublesome for anybody in the\nemergency room.",

I have put\nthe value of 10 mescaline units (M.U.) into the literature and this\nwould imply that maybe 30 milligrams was an active dose.  This is\nprobably too low, and some day I would like to run an experiment with\nthe entire research group with this compound to see just what it\nreally does.\n\n\nThe essential oil that corresponds to DMMDA is, of course, apiole from\nthe Oil of Parsley, which again ties together the spice world and the\namphetamine world.  And there is isoapiole, also a natural thing.\nThis pair represents the ring-substitution pattern of one of the ten\nessential oils and DMMDA is one of the ten essential amphetamines.\n\n\nSeveral people have asked me what I thought about the potential\nactivity of a compound with a methyl group added to DMMDA.  One of\nthese possibilities would be the N-methylated derivative,\n2,5-dimethoxy-N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, or METHYL-DMMDA\n(or DMMDMA for the dimethoxy-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine\nnomenclature).  It is a MDMA analogue, and is described in the recipe\nfor METHYL-MMDA-2.\n\n\nThe placement of an added methyl group onto the beta-position of DMMDA,\nrather than on the nitrogen atom, produces a pair of stereoisomeric\nhomologues.  These are the threo- (or-trans-) and erythro- (or\ncis)-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamines.  They have\nnever been assigned trivial names (my original codes for them were\nS-1495 and S-1496 which is not too intuitively informative).  Their\nchemically proper names would have the 2-amino-3-substituted\nphenylbutane form.  The synthesis of these DMMDA homologues started\nwith the reduction of the nitrosyrene to the ketone (see under\nMETHYL-MMDA-2 for this preparation), followed by methylation with\nfresh sodium isopropoxide and methyl iodide, to give the beta-methyl\nproduct.  This formed the two possible oximes, one with a mp of 120\n°C, and the other from MeOH with a mp of 146 °C.  The 120 °C oxime,\nwith fresh sodium ethoxide gave\nthreo-2-amino-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butane\nhydrochloride.  This salt had a mp of 247-249 °C.  The 146 °C oxime\ngave erythro-2-amino-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butane\nhydrochloride with a mp of 188-189 °C.  The threo-isomer showed a\npossible threshold effect at 80 milligrams, with hyperventilation and\nperhaps some mental muddiness.  The erythro-isomer showed no effects,\nbut it had been taken up only to 10 milligrams.\n\n\nThe only other beta-methyl homologue of an active material that was\nexplored chemically, was related to MDA.  The ketone\n(3,4-piperonylacetone, see under MDMA) was methylated with sodium\nisopropoxide and methyl iodide, and a crystalline oxime was obtained.\nReduction with Zn dust gave what appeared to be\n2-amino-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butane hydrochloride, but there\nwere sufficient uncertainties (possible dimethylation, only one oxime\nisolated, the need of strong reducing conditions) that the entire\nproject was placed in, and still is in, an indefinite holding pattern.\nThe similar analogues for DOM are the two Classic Ladies, DAPHNE and\nELVIRA, and they, too, are for some time in the future.",

The RHS which is the third letter of BOHH\nstands for the free hydroxyl group.  And the final RHS is for\nhomopiperonylamine (which is the trivial name for the compound without\nthe hydroxyl group).  BOHH, or\n3,4-methylenedioxy-beta-hydroxyphenethylamine, or\n3,4-methylenedioxy-beta-ethanolamine, has also be assayed in man at up to\n100 milligrams without any effects, and must be considered, as of now,\nto be inactive centrally.  The possible toxic roles of beta-ethanolamines\nas potential adrenolytic agents, have been discussed in the BOHD\nrecipe.  And beware of the use of the code name MDE in the very old\nliterature.  It might be this BOHH compound.",

    description: "These \"Qualitative Comments\" are not\nexplicit quotations from people who had taken 3,4-DMA.  They are\nwritten descriptions by the observers who had given 3,4-DMA to\npsychiatric patients.  This is one of the most outrageous chapters in\nthe books on military medicine.  The chemical warfare group within the\nU.S. Army explored many potential psychedelics by administering them\nto innocent patients with not even a thought of obtaining informed\nconsent.  These experiments took place at the New York State\nPsychiatric Institute (amongst other places) in the early 1960's.  The\nEdgewood Arsenal code name for 3,4-DMA was EA-1316.  A few\nnon-military studies have indicated that 3,4-DMA is orally active at\n160 milligrams, and so probably its potency by this more conventional\nroute would fall midway between that of mescaline and of MDA.  The\n3-methoxy-4-other-than-methoxy things (such as hydroxy, ethoxy,\nallyloxy and methyl) are mentioned in the recipe for MEPEA.  The\nalpha-ethyl homologue of 3,4-DMA,\n2-amino-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butane, and of other DMA's are\ndiscussed under the recipe for ARIADNE.\n\n\nThere are a total of six possible amphetamine molecules with two\nmethoxyl groups attached.  The 3,4-orientation has always been the\nmost appealing to the life scientists as this is the positional\nsubstitution pattern found in the natural neuro-chemicals dopamine,\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.  These latter two are called\nnoradrenalin and adrenalin in England.  Two adjacent hydroxy groups\nrepresent the catechol in the well known word catecholamines.  You\nmight read in a textbook, \"This is where nature placed the groups when\nshe put the compounds in our brains.  So that is where the groups\nmight be the most interesting in a psychedelic.\" Why?  I have never\nunderstood this kind of reasoning.  If a possible psychedelic has just\nthe exact oxygen positioning of a neurotransmitter, then, voila,\nthat's why it is active.  And if a possible psychedelic has some\npositioning of these oxygen atoms that is different than that of a\nneurotransmitter?  Then voila again.  That's why it is active.  Both\nsound equally reasonable to me, and neither one even begins to address\nthe fundamental question, how do the psychedelic drugs do what they\ndo?  A study in the human animal of the intimate effects of one of\nthese neurotransmitter analogues might bring us a little bit closer to\nanswering this fundamental question.  But maybe it wouldn't, after\nall.  Nothing has made much sense so far!  Anyway, 3,4-DMA is one of\nthe ten essential amphetamines that can, in theory, arise from the ten\nessential oils of the spice and herb trade.  In this case, the origins\nare methyl eugenol and methyl isoeugenol.\n\n\nTwo of these \"different\" isomers, 2,4-DMA and 2,5-DMA, have already\nbeen discussed in their own separate recipes.  And the remaining three\nof the six possible DMA's that are \"different\" have been made and\nstudied pharmacologically in animals but not in man.  These are the\n2,3-DMA, 2,6-DMA and the 3,5-DMA isomers.  The products of their\nreaction with elemental bromine are discussed under META-DOB.\n\n\nBoth the 2,6- and the 3,5-isomers, as the N,N-dimethyl homologues,\nhave been looked at as potential radio-halogen recipients in the\nsearch for positron-emitting brain blood-flow indicators, as discussed\nin the recipe for IDNNA.  Both were made from the appropriate\nnitrostyrene via the corresponding phenylacetone.\n\n\nThe 2,6-isomer was derived from 2,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde.  This, in\nnitroethane and ammonium acetate, gave the nitrostyrene as\ncanary-yellow crystals from MeOH that melted at 101.5-102.5 °C.\nElemental iron in acetic acid converted this nitrostyrene to\n2,6-dimethoxyphenylacetone (a water-white oil with boiling point of\n95-105 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg. Anal. (C11H14O3) C,H) and reductive amination\nwith dimethylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride gave\n2,6-dimethoxy-N,N-di-methylamphetamine perchlorate (2,6-DNNA) with a\nmelting point of 109-110 °C.  This base was readily fluorinated with\n18F acetylhypofluorite and iodinated with chloramine-T-oxidized 122I\niodide ion.  It was also halogenated with (non-radioactive) bromine\nand iodine monochloride to give the corresponding 3-bromo-(and\n3-iodo)-2,6-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamines but these, in turn, did\nnot react with radioactive acetyl hypofluorite.\n\n\nThe 3,5-isomer followed precisely the same flow sheet.\n3,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde gave the nitrostyrene (with a melting point\nof 87-88 °C), the phenylacetone (with a boiling point of 110-130 °C at\n0.3 mm/Hg) and the product 3,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine\nperchlorate (3,5-DNNA) with a melting point of 100-101 °C.  This also\nreacted readily with 18F acetylhypofluorite and 122I-hypoiodite.\nSeveral alpha-ethyl homologues of these compounds have also been\ndiscussed in the recipe for ARIADNE.",

    description: "The qualitative information on 2,5-DMA is\nvery sparse.  I was up to a 1+ with 80 milligrams of the\nhydrochloride, and since it appeared to be totally a physical trip\nwith tremors and some cardiovascular push and nothing of a sensory\nnature, I chose to explore it no further.  A report from South America\nfound the intoxication to be largely pleasant (this, at 75\nmilligrams), with an enhanced interest in one's surroundings, but no\nperceptual changes, no overt stimulation, and no gross physiological\neffects other than a slight mydriasis (dilation of the pupils).  I\nhave also been told of a single trial of 250 milligrams of the\ntartrate (this is equivalent to somewhere in the 150-200 milligram\nrange of the hydrochloride salt, depending upon the acid/base ratio of\nthe tartrate salt) with some \"speedy\" effects but still no sensory\nchanges.  A seizure of capsules reported by the drug law enforcement\nauthorities some 20 years ago found that each contained some 200\nmilligrams of the hydrobromide salt.  This is equivalent to 170\nmilligrams of the hydrochloride salt, and suggests that level may be\nan effective dosage.\n\n\nAn intriguing, but little studied, analogue of 2,5-DMA is the compound\nwith methyls in place of the methoxyls.  2,5-Dimethylamphetamine has\nbeen looked at, in man, as a potential anorexic, but there is little\neffect even at 150 milligrams.  The 3,4-isomer,\n3,4-dimethylamphetamine or xylopropamine, is an adrenergic agent and\nit has been found to be an analgesic in man at as little as 10\nmilligrams.  This was assayed, rather remarkably, by attaching\nelectrodes to the tooth fillings of the experimental subjects.  But\nwith this base, cardiovascular effects were not observed until doses\nof about 100 milligrams were administered, and toxic effects (nausea\nand vomiting) were reported at 150 milligrams.  There was no\nsuggestion of anything psychedelic.\n\n\nAll three isomers of monomethylamphetamine have also been looked at in\nman.  The ortho- and meta-isomers, 2-methyl- (and 3-methyl- )\namphetamine are weak anorexics.  At doses of up to 150 milligrams\norally, there were signs of stimulation noted--talkativeness and loss\nof appetite.  The para-isomer, 4-methyl-amphetamine or Aptrol, is more\npotent.  At 75 milligrams (orally, in man) there is clear adrenergic\nstimulation, and at twice this dosage there are signs of mild toxicity\nsuch as salivation, coughing and vomiting.\n\n\nThere is a mystery, at least to me, concerning the commercial\nproduction of 2,5-DMA.  At regular intervals, there is a public\nannouncement of the production quotas that are requested or allowed by\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, for drugs that have been placed\nin Schedules I or II.  In the Schedule I category there are usually\nlisted amounts such as a gram of this, and a few grams of that.  These\nare probably for analytical purposes, since there are no medical uses,\nby definition, for drugs in this Schedule.  But there is a staggering\nquantity of 2,5-DMA requested, regularly.  Quantities in the many tens\nof millions of grams, quantities that vie with medical mainstays such\nas codeine and morphine.  I have heard that this material is used in\nthe photographic industry, but I have no facts.  Somewhere I am sure\nthat there is someone who has to keep a lot of very careful books!\n\n\nIn the area of psychedelic drugs, the value of 2,5-DMA is mainly in\nits role as a precursor to the preparation of materials that can come\nfrom a direct electrophilic attack on the activated 4-position.  These\nuses can be found under things such as DOB and DOI and DON.  The\nradio-halogenation of N-substituted homologues of 2,5-DMA with\nhypoiodite or hypofluorite is part of an extensive study underway in\nthe search for radio-labeled brain blood flow agents.  The rationale\nfor this work is to be found in the commentary under IDNNA.  In\nessence it has been found that the N-substitution or\nN,N-disubstitution of 2,5-DMA where the 4-position is unsubstituted\nand thus available for the introduction of a radioactive nucleus can\ngive rise to potentially useful drugs.  Most of these 2,5-dimethoxy\nexploratory compounds were made by the reductive alkylation of\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(radio)iodophenylacetone, using various mono or\ndialkyl amines.  This, too, is described under IDNNA.\n\n\nHowever, the study of various direct iodinations and fluoridations\nthat would have the N,N-dimethyl substitution on the amphetamine\nnitrogen atom, would require the 4-proteo- analogue, and this was made\nfrom the above nitrostyrene.  A solution of the above nitrostyrene,\n22.3 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene in 100 mL acetic acid\nwas added to a suspension of elemental iron in acetic acid (45 g in\n250 mL) and worked up with water and base washing to give, after\ndistillation at 92-106 °C at 0.35 mm/Hg, 13.8 g\n2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetone as a pale yellow oil.  This underwent\nreductive amination with dimethylamine hydrochloride in MeOH solution,\nusing sodium cyanoborohydride, to give the target compound\n2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine oxalate with a melting point of\n133-134 °C (4.6 g ketone gave 1.38 g of salt).  Anal. (C15H23NO6) C,H.\nIt has also been prepared by the N,N-dimethylation of 2,5-DMA\ndirectly, with formaldehyde and formic acid.  This has been called\n2,5-DNNA, or IDNNA without the \"I.\" This intermediate, 2,5-DNNA,\nunderwent direct radioiodination with labeled iodine monochloride in\nthe presence of perchloric acid to give IDNNA with a 40% incorporation\nof isotope.  Reaction with labeled acetyl hypofluorite, on the other\nhand, gave only a 2% in-corporation of the radio-isotope.  This latter\ncompound is, chemically,\n4-fluoro-2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine and, using the\nreasoning suggested above and with IDNNA, might best be encoded FDNNA.\n\n\nThe 2,5-dimethylamphetamine analogue mentioned above was also explored\nin this IDNNA concept.  The commercially available\n2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde was converted to the nitrostyrene with\nnitroethane (1-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-2-nitropropene, yellow crystals\nwith a melting point of 24.5-25.5 °C) which reacted with elemental\niron in acetic acid to give the ketone 2,5-dimethylphenylacetone\n(boiling at 140-150 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg).  Reductive amination with\ndimethylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride gave 2,5-DMNNA\n(2,5,N,N-tetramethylamphetamine) as a clear oil with a boiling point\nof 115-125 °C at 0.35 mm/Hg.  It gave poor yields of the 4-fluoro\nanalogue with acetyl hypofluorite.\n\n\nAll of these latter materials remain unevaluated in man.",

    description: "What can one say as to the active dosage of\n2,4-DMA?  Nothing.  What can one say as to the duration?  Probably\nshort.  The 60 milligram report given above is the highest level that\nI personally know of having been tried in man, and there is no hint as\nto what might be found at a fully active dose, or just where that dose\nmight be.  It might be fully speedy.  It might be fully psychedelic.\nIt might give a cardiovascular push that would be scary.  Studies of\n2,4-DMA on vascular strips (associated with serotonin action) were not\nimpressive in comparison with structurally related psychedelics, and\nit seems as if its action might involve norepinephrine release.  It is\na reasonable guess that there would be cardio-vascular activity at\nhigher levels.  But it will only be with human trials, someday, that\nthe answer will be known for sure.\n\n\nThe meta-orientation of the two methoxyl groups does, however, greatly\nincrease the susceptibility of the aromatic ring to electrophilic\nattack.  This is one of the three possible meta-dimethoxy substituted\namphetamines, and it is the best studied one in the pursuit of\npotential radio-halogen substituted brain blood-flow agents.  This\nstrategy is discussed under IDNNA; the other two meta-compounds are\ndiscussed under 3,4-DMA.\n\n\nThe homologues of 2,4-DMA that were iodinated (or occasionally\nfluor-inated) were mono- or di-alkylated on the nitrogen, and the\nprecursor that was common to all was the corresponding acetone.  The\nabove nitrostyrene, 1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene, was\nreduced in acetic acid with elemental iron, and the base-washed\nextracts stripped of solvent and distilled (125-145 °C at 0.5 mm/Hg)\nto give 2,4-dimethoxyphenylacetone as a water-white oil.  The\nprincipal reductive amination product of this, the one that was most\nthoroughly explored with various halogenation schemes, was obtained by\nthe reaction of 2,4-dimethoxyphenylacetone with dimethylamine and\nsodium cyanoborohydride.  This product,\n2,4-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine or 2,4-DNNA, distilled at\n105-115 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg and formed a perchlorate salt that melted at\n98-98.5 °C.  This could be iodinated with the radio-iodide anion, when\noxidized with chloramine-T in buffered sulfuric acid, to give the\niodinated analogue (2,4-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethyl-5-iodoamphetamine) in\nan excellent yield.  Radio-fluorination with acetyl hypofluorite gave\nthe 5-fluoroanalogue (2,4-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethyl-5-fluoroamphetamine)\nin an acceptable yield.  Both compounds went into a rat's brain to a\npretty good extent, but both of them washed out too rapidly to be\nclinically interesting.\n\n\nA large family of other N-substituted homologues of 2,4-DMA were\nsimilarly prepared from the above ketone and sodium cyanoborohydride.\nMethylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine and hexylamine\ngave the corresponding N-alkyl homologues.  The N,N-diethyl homologue\nwas made from the primary amine, 2,4-DMA itself, with acetaldehyde and\nsodium cyanoborohydride but the product,\nN,N-diethyl-2,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, could not be converted into a\ncrystalline hydrochloride salt.\n\n\nYet another variation on these structures was launched, again with the\ndesign of making radio-iodination targets which are not psychedelic\nand thus might be useful clinically.  In this variation, the nitrogen\natom substitution pattern was held constant, with two methyl groups,\nas were the ring locations of the two oxygen atoms.  But the\nidentities of the alkyl groups on these oxygen atoms were varied.  The\nsynthetic procedure followed was to make the appropriate\n2,4-dialkoxybenzaldehyde, convert it to the nitrostyrene with\nnitroethane, reduce this to the phenylacetone with elemental iron, and\nthen reductively aminate this ketone with dimethylamine.  Following\nthis reaction scheme, five amphetamine homologues of 2,4-DMA were\nmade, three with the 4-methoxy group maintained but the 2-position\nextended, and two with both groups extended symmetrically.  These are:\n(1) N,N-dimethyl-2-ethoxy-4-methoxyamphetamine; (2)\n2-(n)-butyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-4-methoxy-amphetamine; (3)\n2-(n)-decyloxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine; (4)\n2,4-diethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine; and (5)\nN,N-dimethyl-2,4-di-(i)-propoxyamphetamine.  I believe that most of\nthese have been iodinated and assayed in rats, and several of them\nappear quite promising.  But none of them have been assayed in man,\nyet.  The bromination product of 2,4-DMA\n(5-bromo-2,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, 5-Br-2,4-DMA) is way down in\nactivity (see its recipe, separately).  Since all iodo analogues are\nof about the same potency as the bromo counterparts, and since the\naddition of two methyl groups on the nitrogen does not appear to\nenhance central activity, I feel the iodination products of these\nN,N-dialkyl-dialkoxyamphetamines would not have any interesting\npsychopharmacology.\n\n\nThere is something vaguely counterproductive, in my evaluation of\nthings, when the goal of a research project is to avoid activity\nrather than to create it.  Although this chemistry was completely\nfascinating and could have produced the world's best\npositron-emitting, brain-scanning diagnostic compound, I feel it quite\nunlikely that it would have produced the world's best\ninsight-revealing, empathy-enhancing psychedelic, so this research\ndirection never totally caught my fancy.  I went on to other things.",

Some of these warts are things attached with a oxygen\natom; there are some of these in every single compound in this story.\nNo oxygen atom, no psychedelic effect.  Without them, one has\nstimulants or, more frequently, no effects at all.\n\n\nBut the removal of an oxygen atom (in those cases where there is more\nthan one) can radically change the nature of the effects seen.  This\nis the exact meaning of the term \"desoxy.\" \"Des\", without, and \"oxy\",\nthe oxygen.  Since this drug is simply the structure of mescaline with\nthe oxygen at the 4-position plucked out of the picture, the first\nimpulse was to abbreviate this compound as DOM for des-oxymescaline.\nHowever, a long, long time ago, in a universe far, far away, a\ncompound was synthesized that had a methoxy group replaced by a\nmethyl, and it was already named DOM.  This was the first of the STP\nanalogs, and the initials stood for desoxy (DO, losing an oxygen) and\nmethyl (M, having it replaced with a methyl group).  These are two\ndifferent worlds.  One M stands for Mescaline, and the other M stands\nfor Methyl.  Let's call it 4-desoxymescaline, or simply DESOXY, and be\nexact.\n\n\nThis drug is a prime example of a pharmacological challenge directed\nto the metabolic attack at the 4-position as a mechanism for the\nexpression of biological activity.  A methoxy group there would allow\neasy removal of the methyl group from the oxygen by some demethylation\nprocess, but a bare methyl group there cannot be removed by any simple\nprocess. It must be removed by a very difficult oxidation.\n\n\nThis is not the first time that oxygen atoms have been removed from\nthe mescaline molecule.  Both the 3,5-dideoxymescaline\n(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxyphenethylamine) and 3,4,5-trideoxymescaline\n(also called desoxymescaline in the literature, but really\ntri-desoxymescaline or 3,4,5-trimethylphenethylamine) have been\nstudied in the cat, and have shown extraordinary pharmacological\nprofiles of CNS action.  The trimethyl compound showed behavior that\nwas interpreted as being intense mental turmoil, accompanied by a\nstartling rise in body temperature.  The significance is hard to\ndetermine, in that LSD gave similar responses in the cat, but\nmescaline was without effects at all.  No human studies have been made\non these compounds, just animal studies.  But they might prove upon\ntrial in man to be most revealing.  They would have to be performed\nwith exceptional care.\n\n\nThe 3-carbon chain amphetamines that correspond to these mescaline\nlook-alikes with one or more methoxy groups replaced with methyl\ngroups, are largely untested and would require independent and novel\nsyntheses.  The 3,4,5-trimethylamphetamine is known, and is known to\nbe very hard on experimental cats.\n\n\nA mescaline analogue with a bromo atom in place of the 4-methoxyl\ngroup is an analogue of mescaline in exactly the same way that DOB (a\nvery potent am-phetamine) is an analog of TMA-2 (the original\ntrisubstituted amphetamine).  This analogue,\n3,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine, has been found to be a most\neffective serotonin agonist, and it is a possibility that it could be\na most potent phenethylamine.

I fully expect both\n3,5-D and 2,6-D to be indistinguishable from mescaline in effect,\nsince it is known that not much metabolism takes place in man at these\nlocations of the molecule.\n\n\nThe last compound, alpha-D, could be quite a different matter.  The\nprincipal metabolite of mescaline is 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic\nacid, and this product requires enzymatic attack at the exact position\nwhere the deuteriums will be located.  To the extent that they are\nharder to remove (come off more slowly or to a lesser degree), to that\nextent the molecule will be more potent in man, and the dosage\nrequired for effects will be less.  The compound will be easily made\nby the reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile with lithium\naluminum deuteride.  And if there is a believable difference between\nalpha-D and mescaline, it will be necessary to synthesize each of the two\noptically active alpha-mono-deutero analogs.  That will be quite a\nchallenge.\n\n\nSome years ago I performed a fascinating series of experiments with\nanother isotopically labeled mescaline derivative.  This was beta-14C\nlabeled material, which I self-administered on three occasions, at\nthree different levels.  One dosage was with 350 milligrams, a second\na few weeks later was with 4 milligrams, and a third was a few weeks\nlater yet, with about 60 micrograms.  In each case, exactly the same\nabsolute quantity of radioactivity was administered, so the metabolic\ndistribution was equally visible.  Only the weight dosage was\ndifferent.  Urinary analysis was run for each experiment for the\npresence of unchanged mescaline, and for the primary metabolite,\n3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid.  The smaller the dosage, the\nproportionately larger amount of mescaline was oxidized to the\ninactive acetic acid, and the smaller amount was excreted in an\nunchanged state.  It seemed to me that there might be a finite\ncapacity of the body to oxidatively deaminate mescaline, and at larger\nand larger dosages, this capacity became increasingly depleted.\nPerhaps this is why mescaline requires such a large dosage to be\neffective in man.",

It is possible to imagine that, in such individuals,\nthe effects of substituting trideuteromethyl groups for normal methyl\ngroups might result in psychopharmacological differences of action.\nTwo reports exist that describe metabolic products of mescaline that\nhave lost this methyl group on the 4-position oxygen.

There are some similarities in pharmacology\nso that if there is a bromine or an iodo atom present in a drug, it is\na fair guess that the corresponding beta-fluoroethyl would also be\nactive.  In a sense, the cute (and chemically impossible) idea of\nputting a bromo atom on the sulfur of the 2C-T family is nicely\nsatisfied by using the beta-fluoroethyl group instead (which is\nchemically completely possible).\n\n\nA logical extension of 2C-T-21 is the three carbon amphetamine\nanalogue which should be, by comparing structures and activities, a\nvery potent and in-teresting material in its own rights.  This would\nbe 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)amphetamine or, following the\nnomenclature used with the earlier members of this series, ALEPH-21.\nA solution of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)benzaldehyde (see\nearlier in this recipe) in nitroethane with ammonium acetate gave\n1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)phenyl)-2-nitropropene as\nyellow-orange crystals from MeOH with a melting point of 102-104 °C.\nAnd that is where the project now stands.  It has not yet been reduced\nto the amine.\n\n\nThis phenethylamine, 2C-T-21, was the last of the 2C-T's to be\ncompleted.  A couple of other sulfur analogues have been given\nnumbers, and have been started, but the syntheses are still at some\nintermediate state.\n\n\nThe (n)-butyl compound, named 2C-T-19, has been taken to the\nnitrostyrene stage.  Reaction between 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and\n(n)-butylbromide with KOH gave 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl (n)-butyl sulfide\nas a colorless oil.  This, with phosphorus oxychloride and\nN-methylformanilide, provided\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-butylthio)benzaldehyde as pale orange solids from\nMeOH, with a melting point of 78-79 °C.  This, with nitromethane and\nammonium acetate, gave 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-butylthio)-beta-nitrostyrene,\nwith a melting point of 133-134 °C from either IPA or acetonitrile.\n\n\nThe 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl compound, which I have named 2C-T-22, has\nbeen taken to the benzaldehyde stage.  Reaction between\n2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyliodide with KOH gives\n2,5-dimethoxyphenyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl sulfide as a very pale amber\noil.  This, with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide\nprovided 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzaldehyde as\ncrystals that proved to be exceedingly difficult to purify.  Yellow\nsolids can be obtained from several solvents, and they melt in the 70\n°C area.  The initially isolated fraction melted at 69-72 °C and\nshowed three major spots by both TLC and GCMS.  The largest GC peak\nwas the correct product with a parent peak of 280 m/e, and cracking\nfragments at 154 and 234 m/e.  A small sample was finally obtained\nfrom hexane with a melting point of 78-79 °C but I am not sure that\neven it is particularly pure.  Not surprisingly, the reaction of this\ncrude benz-aldehyde with nitromethane and ammonium acetate gave a\nnitrostyrene product that was a complex mixture.  And there that\nproject also rests.\n\n\nA couple of additional efforts warrant comment.  The reaction between\ntrifluoromethyliodide and 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol should have produced\n2,5-dimethoxyphenyl trifluoromethyl sulfide, but it didn't produce\nanything.  And one more.  What about a bare thio group at the\n4-position in this 2C-T-family?  Maybe this can be protected through\neverything as the disulfide, and be reduced at the last step!  The\ndisulfide, 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl disulfide (see under 2C-T-15) was aimed\ntowards the needed bis-aldehyde with phosphorus oxychloride and\nN-methylformanilide, but all that came out of this were black oils and\ntars.  This has also been abandoned for now.\n\n\nAnd it has just occurred to me that there is yet another effort that\nis certain-ly worth making, inspired by the observation that\n2,2-difluoroethyl iodide is commercially available and not\nprohibitively expensive.  It, with 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol, and\nfollowing the obvious steps to the aldehyde, the nitrostyrene, and the\nfinal amine, would produce\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2,2-difluoroethylthio)phenethylamine hydrochloride.\nIt lies exactly half way between the highly potent 2C-T-21 (the\nmono-fluoro), and the yet to be finished 2C-T-22 (the trifluoro).\nLet's be weird, and call it 2C-T-21.5.  I will wager mucho that it\nwill be very potent.",

    description: "An interesting, and quite logical, habit\nthat seems to always pop up when a lot of talk and energy become\ndirected at a specific compound, is the habit of using a nickname for\nit.  The Tweetios are an example, and in the 2C-T-X family I had\nmentioned the term SESQUI.  Here, this compound was called NIMITZ, for\nthe obvious reason that the major freeway from Oakland to San Jose,\nthe Nimitz freeway, was also called State Highway 17.  Its name has\nbeen changed to Interstate 880, and I guess it could now only be used\nas a reference point if efforts were being made for a 2C-T-880.\n\n\nThe reason that 2C-T-17 is of special theoretic interest is that it is\none of the very first of the active psychedelic compounds (along with\n2C-G-5) to have a potential optically active center on the side of the\nring away from the nitrogen atom.  One of the oldest and best studied\nvariants of the phenethylamine chain are the alpha-methyl homologues,\nthe substituted amphetamines.  Here there is an asymmetric carbon atom\nright next to the amine group, allowing the molecule to be prepared in\neither a right-hand way or a left-hand way.  The \"R\" or the \"S\"\nisomer.  And in the several studies that have looked at such isomers\nseparately, it has always been the \"R\" isomer that has carried the\npsychedelic effects.  This probably says something about the nitrogen\nend, the metabolic end, the \"north\" end of the receptor site that\nrecognizes these compounds, and suggests that there is some intrinsic\nasymmetry in the area that binds near to the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n\nBut very little is known of the receptor's \"south\" end, so to speak,\nthe geometry of the area where the opposite end of the molecule has to\nfit.  Here, with 2-C-17, there is a secondary butyl group, and this\ncontains an asymmetric carbon atom.  But now this center of asymmetry\nis clear across the benzene ring from the nitrogen, and should\ncertainly be in some entirely new part of the receptor site.  Why not\nmake this compound with the \"R\" and the \"S\" forms in this new and\nunusual location?  Why not, indeed!  Why not call them the right-lane\nand the left lane of the Nimitz?  Fortunately, both \"R\" and \"S\"\nsecondary butyl alcohols were easily obtained, and the synthesis given\nabove for the racemic compound was paralleled for each of these\nisomers, separately.  Is there any chemistry that is different with\nthe specific optical isomers from that which has been reported with\nthe racemic?  There certainly is for the first step, since the butyl\nalcohols rather than the butyl bromides must be used, and this first\nstep must go by inversion, and it cannot be allowed any racemization\n(loss of the optical purity of the chiral center).\n\n\nThe synthesis of 2C-T-17 \"R\" required starting with the \"S\" isomer of\nsecondary butanol.  The \"S\" 2-butanol in petroleum ether gave the\nlithium salt with butyllithium which was treated with tosyl chloride\n(freshly crystallized from naphtha, hexane washed, used in toluene\nsolution) and the solvent was removed.  The addition of\n2,5-dimethoxythiophenol, anhydrous potassium carbonate, and DMF\nproduced \"S\"-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl s-butyl sulfide.  The conversion to\n\"R\"-2,5-dimethoxy-4-(s-butyl-thio)benzaldehyde (which melted at 78-79\n°C compared to 86-87 °C for the racemic counterpart) and its\nconversion in turn to the nitrostyrene,\n\"S\"-2,5-dimethoxy-4-(s)-butylthio-beta-nitrostyrene which melted at 70-71\n°C compared to 68-69 °C for the racemic counterpart, followed the\nspecific recipes above.  The preparation of the intermediates to\n2C-T-17 \"S\" follows the above precisely, but starting with \"R\"\n2-butanol instead.  And it is at these nitrostyrene stages that this\nproject stands at the moment.\n\n\nIt would be fascinating if one of the two optically active 2C-T-17's\ncarried all of the central activity, and the other, none of it.  What\nis more likely is that the spectrum of effects will be teased apart,\nwith one isomer responsible for some of them and the other isomer\nresponsible for the others.  Then, again, maybe the south end of the\nreceptor site in the brain is totally symmetric, and the two optical\nantipodes will be indistinguishable.\n\n\nAn incidental bit of trivia--yet another bit of evidence that we are\nall totally asymmetric in our personal body chemistry.  \"R\" and \"S\"\nsecondary butanols smell different.  The \"R\" has a subtle smell, which\nis rather fragrant .  The \"S\" is stronger, hits the nasal passages\nharder, and reminds one of isopropanol more than does the \"R\" isomer.",

    description: "Here is another example of the presentation\nof a compound for which there has not yet been an effective level\ndetermined.  Why?  For a very good reason.  This is an example of a\nwhole class of compounds that I have called the pseudos, or the\npsi-compounds.  Pseudo- as a prefix in the literary world generally\nstands for \"false.\" A pseudopod is a thing that looks like a foot, but\nisn't one.  A pseudonym is a fictitious name.  But in chemistry, it\nhas quite a different meaning.  If something has a common name, and\nthere is a second form (or isomer, or shape, or orientation) that is\npossible and it doesn't have a common name, it can be given the name\nof the first form with a Rpseudo-S attached.  Ephedrine is the\nerythro-isomer of N-methyl-beta-hydroxyamphetamine.  There is a second\nstereoisomer, the threo- isomer, but it has no trivial name.  So it is\ncalled pseudoephedrine, or the \"Sudafed\" of sinus decongestant fame.\n\n\nThe pseudo-psychedelics are the 2,4,6-trisubstituted counterparts of\nthe 2,4,5-trisubstituted psychedelics.  Almost all of the\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-something-or-other compounds are active and\ninteresting whether they be phenethylamines or amphetamines, and it is\nan exciting fact that the 2,6-dimethoxy-4-something-or-other compounds\nare going be just as active and just as interesting.  A number of\nexamples have already been mentioned.  TMA-2 is\n2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (a 2,5-dimethoxy-substituted compound with\na methoxyl at the 4-position).  The pseudo- analogue is TMA-6\n(2,4,6-trimethoxyamphetamine) and it is every bit as potent and\nfascinating.  Z-7 could be called pseudo-DOM, and although it is quite\na bit down in potency, it is an active drug and will both demand and\nreceive much more clinical study some day.\n\n\nWill the other 2,4,5-things spawn 2,4,6-things that are active?\nWithout a shadow of a doubt.  Chemically, they are much more difficult\nto synthesize.  The 2,5-dimethoxy orientation made the 4-position a\nnatural and easy target.  The 2,6-dimethoxy orientation pushes for\n3-substitution, and the 4-position is completely unnatural.  Tricks\nare needed, but tricks have now been found.  The above synthesis of\npseudo-2C-T-4 shows one such trick.  This is, in my opinion, the\nexciting chemistry and psychopharmacology of the next decade.  Well\nover half of all the psychedelic drugs mentioned in Book II are\n2,4,5-trisubstituted compounds, and every one of them has a\n(potentially active) 2,4,6-pseudo-counterpart.\n\n\nIt goes yet further.  The antidepressant series of \"Ariadne\" compounds\nare 1-phenyl-2-aminobutanes.  But the 1-phenyl is again a\n2,4,5-trisubstituted compound.  The 2,4,6-isomer will give rise to a\npseudo-Ariadne family, and I will bet that they too will be\nantidepressants.  The 1-phenyl-2-aminobutane analog of psi-2C-T-4 is the\n2,4,6-analogue and it has been prepared as far as the nitrostyrene.\nIt has not yet been reduced, so it is not yet been evaluated, but it\ncould be a most remarkable psycho-pharmacological probe.\n\n\nAnd it goes yet yet further.  Think back to the six possible TMA's.\nTMA and TMA-3 were relatively inactive.  And TMA-2 and TMA-6 were the\ninteresting ones.  The first gave rise to the last twenty years of\npsychedelic chemistry, and the other (as speculated upon above) will\ngive rise to the forthcoming ten years.  But what of TMA-4 and TMA-5?\nBoth showed activity that was more than TMA but less than that of the\n-2 or -6 isomers.  Could they, some day, provoke yet other families of\npsychedelics?  Maybe the 3-position of these two might be focal points\nof leverage as to psychological activity.  What are the letters that\nfollow y in the Greek alphabet?  If I remember correctly, the next\nletter is the last letter, omega.  So, I guess that Nature is trying\nto tell us something, that the -4 and -5 isomers will not engender\ninteresting families.  What a pity.  The chemistry is so unthinkably\ndifficult that it would have been a true challenge.  My next\nincarnation, maybe?",

The\nbenzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a\nmelting point of 73-75 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting\npoint of 122-123 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of\n202-204 °C.  Fifty milligrams was a completely effective level.  The\neffects were felt very quickly.  Vision was blurred, and there were\nintense eyes-closed visuals and the generation of a pleasant,\ncontemplative mood.  Baseline was re-established in five or six hours,\nbut sleep was restless, with weird dreams.  Nasal administration\nshowed considerable variation between individuals, but a typical dose\nwas 10 milligrams.\n\n\nThe 5-EtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is\n5-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-2-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CT2-5ETO.  The\nbenzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-2-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a\nmelting point of 49 °C, but it was impure.  The nitrostyrene\nintermediate melted at 107-108 °C, and the final hydrochloride had a\nmelting point of 180 °C.  At levels of 20 milligrams, there was a\nslow, gentle climb to a full effect at the third or fourth hour.  The\nflooding of thoughts and easy conversation lasted for many hours, and\non some occasion a sedative was needed at the 16 hour point.  There\nwas a feeling of being drained for the following day or two.  Some\nintoxication was still noted in the second day.  Again it is true\nhere, as had been stated as a generality, that the 5-Tweetio analogues\nhave potencies similar to that of the parent compound, but show a much\nlonger duration.  The nickname of \"forever yours\" had been applied.\nThere may indeed be insight, but 24 hours' worth is an awful lot of\ninsight.\n\n\nThe 2,5-DiEtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is\n2,5-diethoxy-4-ethylthiophen-ethylamine, or 2CT2-2,5DIETO.  The\nbenzaldehyde, 2,5-diethoxy-4-(ethylthio)benzaldehyde, had a melting\npoint of 84-85 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of\n123-124 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 220-221 °C.\nLevels that were evaluated from 10 to 50 milligrams were not\nparticularly different in intensity, but were progressively longer in\nduration.  At 50 milligrams there was a nervousness and edginess\nduring the early part of the experience, but for the next several\nhours there was evident both energy and high attentiveness.

Although the\nfirst of these (this compound, called 2C-T) was prepared at the same\ntime as ALEPH-1, there was a lapse of about four years between their\ntrials.  The relatively low potency of 2C-T was a bit discouraging.\nBut the methodical pursuit of the higher 2C-T's (to parallel the\nhigher ALEPHs) proved to be a treasure house, and they have been\nexplored much further than any of the ALEPHs.\n\n\nA note on the RTS in 2C-T.

    description: "With an entirely new hetero atom in the\nmolecule (the selenium), and with clear indications that large dosages\nwould be needed (100 milligrams. or more), some discretion was felt\ndesirable.  There was certainly an odd taste and an odd smell.  I\nremember some early biochemical work where selenium replaced sulfur in\nsome amino acid chemistry, and things got pretty toxic.  It might be\nappropriate to get some general animal toxicity data before exploring\nthose dosages that might get to a +++.\n\n\nWhat doors are opened by the observation that the selenium analog of\n2C-T is an active compound?  The potency appears to be in the same\nball park, whether there is a sulfur atom or a selenium atom there.\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the thing that is hung onto the hetero-atom,\nthe selenium, the most active (and as first approximation the most\nsafe) analogue would be the same ones that are the most potent with\nsulfur.  These would probably be the Se-ethyl, the Se-propyl, or the\nSe-isopropyl, the analogs of S-ethyl, S-propyl, and S-isopropyl.  If\none were to be systematic, these would be called 2C-SE-2, 2C-SE-4, and\n2C-SE-7.  And a very special place might be held for 2C-SE-21, the\nanalogue of 2C-T-21.  Not only is this of high potential potency, but\nit would certainly be the first time that both fluorine and selenium\nare in the same centrally active drug.  In fact, might not this\ncompound, 2C-SE, be the first compound active within the human CNS\nwith a selenium atom in it?  It is certainly the first psychedelic\nwith this atom in it!\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the hetero-atom itself, there are two more\nknown below selenium in the Periodic Table.  Each deserves some\nspecial comment.  The next atom, directly below selenium, is\ntellurium.  It is more metallic, and its com-pounds have a worse smell\nyet.  I heard a story about a German chemist, many years ago, who was\ncarrying a vial of dibutyl telluride in his pocket in a passenger\ncoach from here to there in Germany, back at about the turn of the\ncentury.  It fell to the floor and broke.  No one could remain in the\ncar, and no amount of decontamination could effectively make the smell\ntolerable.  Scratch one railway coach.  But the compound, 2C-TE, would\nbe readily makeable.  Dimethyl ditelluride is a known thing.\n\n\nHowever, the atom below tellurium (and at the bottom of that\nparticular column of the Periodic Table) is the element polonium.\nHere one must deal in terms of theory, as far as human activity goes,\nsince there are no non-radioactive isotopes of polonium.  The only\nreadily available isotope is that with mass 210, which is also called\nRadium F, and is an alpha-particle emitter.  If this were ever to be\nput into a living organism, and if it were to seek out and hang around\nsome particular site of action, that area would be thoroughly and\ncompletely cooked by alpha-particle emission.  It would be a fun\nacademic exercise to make 2C-PO\n(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylpoloneophenethylamine), but in no way could it\never go into anyone.  I knew an eminent physiologist named Dr. Hardin\nJones (now dead) who always argued that the continuing use of drugs\nwould burn out the pleasure center of the brain.  It is a certainty\nthat 2C-PO would, quite literally, do this.  If I ever made it, I\nwould call it HARDINAMINE in his honor.\n\n\nThere was an interesting observation associated with the making of\n2C-SE.  In the synthesis of many of the sulfur compounds (of the 2C-T\nfamily) is was quite common to find, when there was a quantity of some\norganic sulfide let go as a by-product of a reaction on a warm summer\nnight, a number of flies coming into the lab to pay a visit.  On the\nfirst synthesis of the starting material for 2C-SE, a quantity of\nCH3SeH was let go into the environment.  Within minutes, there were\ntwo beautiful dragonflies in the lab.  A coincidence certainly, but\nsomehow, it was a nice message to receive.",

And with very few exceptions, the 2- and the\n5- are methoxyl groups.\n\n\nThe sulfur analogues in this area, compounds with an alkylthio group\nat the 4-position of the 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine backbone, are the\n2C-T things.  The replacement of a sulfur with an oxygen, quite\nrightly, should give rise to the 2C-O counterparts.  And they have\nbeen given the same numbering system that was bestowed upon the RTS\nseries.  2C-T-4 was the 4-isopropylthio compound and one of the most\ninteresting of this family.  And so, quite reasonably, the oxygen\ncoun-terpart should be the 2C-O-4 analogue, and should be one of the\nfirst explored.\n\n\nThe extension of the 4-alkoxy-group led to the discovery of the TMA-2\n--MEM--MIPM--MPM--MBM series of amphetamine analogues.  The\n2-carbon counterparts of these would be a fascinating series to\nexplore, I thought, if there was some encouragement to be had from a\npreliminary try in this field.\n\n\nThis was a first shot in the dark, the actual trial example, and it\ncertainly didn't provide much encouragement.  The three-carbon\nanalogue, MIPM, was made (q.v.) but not explored, following the\ndisappointing trials of MPM.  If this area is ever re-opened, the\nnumbering should reasonably follow the sulfur materials.  The 4-ethoxy\nmaterial would be 2C-O-2, the 4-(n)-propoxy compound 2C-O-7, and the\n4-(n)-butoxy compound 2C-O-19.

These are directly\nabove and below one-another in the periodic table.  And what is\nparticularly maddening to the synthetic diddler, is that they cannot\nbe lengthened, or shortened, or squooshed around in any way.  You\ncan't make a longer and narrower version of a bromine atom, as you can\ndo with, say, a butyl group.  You've got what you've got, like it or\nnot.  No subtle variations.\n\n\nBut, on the brighter side of the picture, you have a heavy atom here,\nand this atom is intrinsic to the central activity of the compound.\nSo, these materials are naturals for radio-labelling experiments.\n2C-I has been made radioactive with radio-iodine, but the most\nimpressive findings have been made with the 3-carbon analog, DOI.\n\n\nOne quotation from an observer of a group experiment is enclosed; an\nexperiment with zero milligrams being taken.  This is a instructive\nobservation of what has been called a contact high.\n\n\nThere is one Iodotweetio known.  In Scrabble, would you challenge a\nword that had seven of its eleven letters as vowels?  Especially if\nthe vowels were, specifically, iooeeio?  It sounds just a little like\nthe noise coming out of Old McDonald's farm.  But a Tweetio there is,\nnamely, the 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-I.  This is\n2-ethoxy-4-iodo-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CI-2ETO.  The\nhydrochloride salt was a white, crystalline product with a melting\npoint of 175-175.5 °C.  The threshold level of activity was seen at an\noral dose of 5 milligrams, and the generated effects were completely\ndispersed in a couple of hours.  Most interestingly, larger doses, of\nup to 50 milligrams orally, seem to produce no more intense an effect,\nbut simply to stretch out this threshold for an additional couple of\nhours.  At no level that has been tried, has 2CI-2EtO produced even a\nplus-two response.\n\n\nWhere else can one go, from 2C-I?  The iodine is the fourth, and the\nlast of the so-called halogens, at the bottom of the classical\nperiodic table.  But, thanks to the miracles that have accompanied us\ninto the nuclear age, there is a fifth halide now known, Astatine.\nAll of its isotopes are radioactive, however, and it seems unlikely\nthat there will ever be an entry (other than this one) for\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-astatophenethylamine.  What might be speculated as to\nits activity?  Probably similar in potency to 2C-I, requiring maybe 10\nor 20 milligrams.  The duration would be dicey to measure, since the\nisotope with the longest known half-life is half decayed in about 8\nhours, and the longest lived natural isotope (for those who insist on\nnatural rather than man-made things) is half decayed in less than a\nminute.  Two predictions would be pretty solid.  You might have quite\na job accumulating your 10 milligrams of Astatine, as the most that\nhas so far been made at one time is only about 0.05 micrograms,\napproximately a millionth of the amount needed.  And the second\nprediction?

Both Lithium-5 and Helium-5 have the\nimpossible half-lives of 10 to the minus 21 seconds.

Sometimes a\nlittle stronger and sometimes a lot stronger.  Then the question\nsuddenly shifts from asking what is different about the\nphenethylamines, to what is different about the amphetamines?  It is\nsimply a historic fact, that in most of my exploring, the amphetamine\nwas made and evaluated first, and so tended to slip into the role of\nthe prototype.  In any case, here the two potencies converge.",

And it\nwas found that the 4-substitution position was of paramount importance\nin both the potency and the quality of action of a compound.  Then,\nlooking at the long-ignored chain, lengthening it by the addition of a\ncarbon atom eliminated all psychedelic effects and gave materials with\nreduced action.  The action present was that of an antidepressant.\nBut removing a carbon atom?  This returned the search to the world of\nmescaline, but with the knowledge of the strong influence of the\n4-position substituent.  The two-carbon side-chain world was\nrediscovered, principally with 2C-B and 2C-D, and the\n4-ethoxy-analogue of mescaline, E.

But a goodly\nnumber of experimental therapists have said that it is excellent in\nextending the action of some other materials.  It seems to boost the\nwaning action of another drug, without adding its own color to the\nexperience.  Yet, the comment above, on the high level of 150\nmilligrams, is a direct quote from the use of this compound in Germany\n(where it is called LE-25) in therapeutic research.\n\n\nThis is probably the most dramatic example of the loss of potency from\nan amphetamine (DOM, active at maybe 3 milligrams) to a phenethylamine\n(only one tenth as active).  It is so often the case that the first of\na series is not the most interesting nor the most potent member.  As\nintriguing and as difficult-to-define as the 2C-D story might be, the\nnext higher homologue of this set, 2C-E, is maximally active at the 15\nto 20 milligram level, and is, without any question, a complete\npsychedelic.\n\n\nThe N-monomethyl and the N,N-dimethyl homologues of 2C-D have been\nsynthesized from 2C-D.  The N-monomethyl compound was obtained by the\nquaternization of the Schiff's base formed between 2C-D and\nbenzaldehyde with methyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis; the\nhydrochloride salt had a melting point of 150-151 °C, from EtOH.  The\nN,N-dimethyl compound resulted from the action of formaldehyde-formic\nacid on 2C-D; the hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 168-169 °C\nfrom EtOH/ether.  These two compounds were some ten times less\neffective in interfering with conditioned responses in experimental\nrats.  There is no report of their having been explored in man.\n\n\n[ Erowid Addition: Darrell Lemaire's Contribution # : In January, 2015, chemist and psychonaut Darrell Lemaire\nannounced that he had decided to come out publicly as the author \"Lazar\" who conducted the \"extensive study\" referenced in the following paragraph.\nFor many years, Mr. Lemaire had preferred to remain anonymous, but the Shulgin Team is helping add credit for his work back into the literature. See Darrell Lemaire Character Vault.] \n\nI have learned of an extensive study of ethoxy homologues of a number\nof the phenethylamines in the 2C-X series; they have been collectively\ncalled the \"Tweetios.\" This Sylvester and Tweety-bird allusion came\ndirectly from the compulsive habit of trying to alleviate the boredom\nof driving long distances (not under the influence of anything) by the\nattempt to pronounce the license plates of cars as they passed.  The\nfirst of this series of compounds had a name that indicated that there\nwas an ethoxy group at the 2-position, or 2-EtO, or Tweetio, and the\nrest is history.  In every compound to be found in the 2C-X family,\nthere are two methoxy groups, one at the 2-position and one at the\n5-position.  There are thus three possible tweetio compounds, a\n2-EtO-, a 5-EtO- and a 2,5-di-EtO-.  Those that have been evaluated in\nman are included after each of the 2C-X's that has served as the\nprototype.  In general, the 2-EtO- compounds have a shorter duration\nand a lower potency, the 5-EtO- compounds have a relatively unchanged\npotency and a longer time duration; the 2,5-di-EtO- homologues are\nvery weak, if active at all.\n\n\nThe 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-D is\n2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-2ETO.  The\nbenzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point\nof 60.5-61 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of\n110.5-111.5 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 207-208\n°C.  The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 171-173 °C.  At\nlevels of 60 milli-grams, there was the feeling of closeness between\ncouples, without an appreciable state of intoxication.  The duration\nwas about 4 hours.\n\n\nThe 5-EtO- homologue of 2C-D is\n5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-5ETO.  The\nbenzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-2-ethoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of\n81-82 °C, and the details of this synthesis are given in the recipe\nfor IRIS.  The nitrostyrene intermediate had a melting point of\n112.5-113.5 °C and the final hydrochloride salt had a melting point of\n197-198 °C.  The hydro-bromide salt had a melting point of 158-159 °C.\nAt dosage levels of 40 to 50 milli-grams, there was a slow, gradual\nclimb to the full effects that were noted in about 2 hours.  The\nexperience was largely free from excitement, but with a friendly\nopenness and outgoingness that allowed easy talk, interaction, humor,\nand a healthy appetite.  The duration of effects was 12 hours.\n\n\nThe 2,5-di-EtO- homologue of 2C-D is\n2,5-diethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-2,5-DIETO.  The\nbenzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of\n102-103 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 108-109\n°C, and the final hydrochloride salt a melting point of 251-252 °C.\nAt a level of 55 milligrams, a plus one was reached, and what effects\nthere were, were gone after four hours.",

I have one report of an intravenous administration of 20\nmilligrams, and the response was described as overwhelming.  The\neffects peaked at about 5 minutes and lasted for perhaps 15 minutes.\n\n\nThe halogens represent a small group of atoms that are unique for a\ncouple of reasons.  They are all located in a single column of the\nperiodic table, being monovalent and negative.  That means that they\ncan be reasonably stable things when attached to an aromatic nucleus.\nBut, being monovalent, they cannot be modified or extended in any way.\nThus, they are kind of a dead end, at least as far as the 2C-X series\nis considered.  The heaviest, iodine, was explored as the\nphen-ethylamine, as 2C-I, and as the amphetamine as DOI.  These are\nthe most potent.  The next lighter is bromine, where the\nphenethylamine is 2C-B and the amphetamine is DOB.  These two are a\nbit less potent, and are by far the most broadly explored of all the\nhalides.  Here, in the above recipe, we have the chlorine counterpart,\n2C-C.  There is also the corresponding amphetamine DOC.  These are\nless potent still, and much less explored.  Why?  Perhaps because\nchlorine is a gas and troublesome to handle (bromine is a liquid, and\niodine is a solid).  The fluorine analogue is yet harder to make, and\nrequires procedures that are indirect, because fluorine (the lightest\nof all the halides) is not only a gas, but is dangerous to handle and\ndoes not react in the usual halogen way.  There will be mention made\nof 2C-F, but DOF is still unexplored.\n\n\nThe treatment of the 2C-B phthalimide described above, with cuprous\ncyanide rather than cuprous chloride, gave rise to the cyano analog\nwhich, on hydrolysis with hydrazine, yielded\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenethylamine (2C-CN).

Prove is used here in the classic British\nsense; i.e., to challenge.  \"The proof of the pudding is in the\neating,\" is not a verification of quality, but an inquiry into the\nquality itself.

The most successful reports have\nfollowed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same\ntime, nor even too closely spaced.  It appears that the optimum time\nfor the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the\nMDMA.  It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be\nmobilized, and something done about them.  This combination has\nseveral enthusiastic advocates in the psychotherapy world, and should\nbe the basis of careful research when these materials become legal,\nand accepted by the medical community.\n\n\nA generalized spectrum of 2C-B action can be gleaned from the many\nreports that have been written describing its effects.  (1) There is a\nsteep dose response curve.  Over the 12 to 24 milligram range, every 2\nmilligrams can make a profound increase or change of response.\nInitially, one should go lightly, and increase the dosage in\nsubsequent trials by small increments.  A commonly used term for a\nlevel that produces a just perceptible effect is \"museum level.\" This\nis a slightly-over-threshold level which allows public activities\n(such as viewing paintings in a museum or scenery watching as a\npassenger in a car) to be entered into without attracting attention.\nThere can be considerable discomfort associated with being in the\npublic eye, with higher doses.  (2) The 2C-B experience is one of the\nshortest of any major psychedelic drug.  Wherever you might be, hang\non.  In an hour or so you will be approaching familiar territory\nagain.  (3) If there is anything ever found to be an effective\naphrodisiac, it will probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure.\n\n\nThere are two \"Tweetios\" known that are related to 2C-B.  (See recipe\n#23 for the origin of this phrase.)  The 2-EtO- homologue of 2C-B is\n4-bromo-2-ethoxy-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2ETO.  The\nunbrominated benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a\nmelting point of 47.5-48.5 °C, the unbrominated nitrostyrene\nintermediate a melting point of 76-77 °C, and the final hydrochloride\na melting point of 185-186 °C.  The hydrobromide salt had a melting\npoint of 168.5-169.5 °C.  It seems that one gets about as much effect\nas can be had, with a dosage of about 15 milligrams, and increases\nabove this, to 30 and to 50 milligrams merely prolong the activity\n(from about 3 hours to perhaps 6 hours).  At no dose was there an\nintensity that in any way resembled that of 2C-B.\n\n\nThe 2,5-DiEtO- homologue of 2C-B is\n4-bromo-2,5-diethoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2,5-DIETO.  The\nunbrominated impure benzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxybenzaldehyde) had a\nmelting point of about 57 °C, the unbrominated impure nitrostyrene\nintermediate a melting point of about 60 °C, and the final\nhydrochloride a melting point of 230-231 °C.  The hydrobromide salt\nhad a melting point of 192-193 °C.  At levels of 55 milligrams, there\nwas only a restless sleep, and strange dreams.  The active level is\nnot yet known.\n\n\nI have been told of some studies that have involved a positional\nrearrangement analogue of 2C-B.  This is\n2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (or 6-BR-DMPEA).  This would be\nthe product of the elemental bromination of DMPEA, and it has been\nassayed as the hydrobromide salt.  Apparently, the intravenous\ninjection of 60 milligrams gave a rapid rush, with intense visual\neffects reported, largely yellow and black.  Orally, there may be some\nactivity at the 400 to 500 milligram area, but the reports described\nmainly sleep disturbance.  This would suggest a stimulant component.\nThe N-methyl homologue of this rearranged compound was even less\nactive.",

There are\na couple of points that might argue for some adrenolytic toxicity.\nThis material is a beta-ethanolamine and, with maybe one or two\nexceptions, clinically used beta-receptor blockers are\nbeta-ethanolamines.  In fact, a few of these so-called beta-blockers\nactually have two methoxy groups on the aromatic rings, also a\nproperty of BOHD.  The antidiabetic drug Butaxamine (BW 64-9 in the\ncode of Burroughs Wellcome) is identical to BOHD except that the\n4-methyl group is on the alpha-carbon instead, and there is a tertiary\nbutyl group on the nitrogen atom.  Another point involves the\nproximity of the beta-hydroxy group and the methoxyl oxygen atom in\nthe 2-position of the ring.  There is going to be a strong\nhydrogen-bonding with this orientation, with the formation of a stable\nsix-membered ring.  This might help obscure the hydrophilic nature of\nthe free hydroxyl group and allow the compound to pass into the brain\neasily.  If this group is masked by an easily removed group such as an\nacetate ester, one gets the compound\nbeta-acetoxy-3,4-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine (BOAD) which is\nsimilar to BOHD as a hypotensive.\n\n\nThe code-naming procedure used here (and elsewhere here in Book II)\nis: (1) to use RBOS as the alert to there being an oxygen on the\nbenzyl carbon of a phenethylamine (it is a benzyl alcohol); (2) if\nthere is just one more letter (a third and last letter) it will\nidentify the 2C-X parent from which it has been derived [RBS comes\nfrom 2C-B, RDS comes from 2C-D, RHS comes from homopiperonylamine\n(MDPEA) rather than from 2C-H, RMS comes from mescaline, and in every\ncase the beta-substituent is a methoxy group]; and (3) if there are\nfour letters, then the fourth letter is as above, and the third letter\n(the next to last letter) is the substituent on that benzylic oxygen.\nWith a three letter code, the substituent is a methyl group, an RHS\nfor a third letter of four makes it a hydroxyl group, and an RAS for\nthe third letter is an acetyl group, and an RES is for an ethyl group.\nA similar sort of cryptographic music was composed by Du Pont in their\nthree-number codes for the Freons.  The first number was one less than\nthe number of carbons in the molecule, the second number was one more\nthan the number of hydrogens in the molecule, the third number was the\nexact number of fluorines in the molecule, and the rest of the bonds\nwere filled with chlorines, Thus Freon 11 (really Freon 011) was\ntrichlorofluoromethane and Freon 116 was hexafluoroethane.\n\n\nComplex, yes.  But both systems are completely straightforward, and\nflexible for future creations.

I feel the term should have been pre-drug, but\npro-drug was the word that caught on.  BOH may well act in the body as\na pro-drug to norepinephrine, but with the temporary blocking of the\npolar functions with ether groups, it can gain access to the brain.\nAnd once there, it can be stripped of these shields and play a direct\nneurological role.  I uncovered a very similar analogy in the\ntryptamine world some years ago.  Just as norepinephrine is a\nneurotransmitter, so is serotonin.

This was the compound alpha,O-dimethylserotonin, or\na,O-DMS.  There is an uncanny analogy between this tryptamine and the\nphenethylamine BOH.\n\n\nSomehow the quiet voice deep inside me says, don't use too much, too\nquickly.  Maybe one of the optical isomers is the body thing, and the\nother isomer is the mind thing.  So far, only the racemic mixture has\nbeen tasted, to the best of my knowledge.",

    description: "This compound, BOD, was the first\nexploratory member of a new family of phenethylamines.  This family is\ncalled the BOX series because an oxygen atom has been put on the\nbenzylic carbon (the \"benzyl-oxy\" or \"BO\") of each of several well\nstudied drugs with recognized substituent patterns on the aromatic\nring.  The \"X\" would be \"D,\" as used here with BOD, making reference\nto 2C-D, it would be a \"B\" in BOB making reference to 2C-B, etc.\nActually the original thought was to make the \"O\" into an \"OM\" for\nmethoxy, as this would allow more versatility in the naming of things\nsuch as ethoxys (\"OE\") or hydroxys (\"OH\"), but the methoxylated 2C-B\nanalogue would have come out as BOMB, so the idea was dropped.\n\n\nActually, the concept of naming of drugs with some acronym that is\npronounceable has led into some interesting byways.  Some examples\nhave been unintended.  I have heard DOM pronounced \"dome\" and DOET\npronounced as \"do it.\" And elsewhere I have mentioned the embarrassing\noccasions where the TOM and TOET families were pronounced \"the toms\nand twats.\" Some examples have had names that have been contractions\nof popular names, such as XTC for ecstasy.  And there are instances\nwhere a name might be proposed simply to irritate the newspaper\npeople.  An early street suggestion for PCP was FUK, and a current\nname for free-base methamphetamine is SNOT.  And marijuana is fondly\ncalled SHIT by its aficionados.  The final \"A\" on government groups\nsuch as the CIA or the DEA or the FDA is strongly reminscent of the\nfinal \"A\" which stands for amphetamine in things such as TMA and MDMA.\nMight there someday be a drug such as\n4-cyclopropylmethyl-N-isopropylamphetamine (CIA), or\n3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine (DEA)?  It has just occurred to me\nthat there is already a 4-fluoro-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (FDA), but I\nhave already named it DOF.  If all drugs were known only by publicly\nembarrassing names, there might be less publicity given them by the\npress.\n\n\nBack to the commentary on BOD.  The rationale for this inclusion of a\nbeta-oxygen atom into the structure of a phenethylamine is based\ndirectly on the chemistry that occurs naturally in the brain.  The\nphenethylamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, is converted both in the\nbrain and in the body to the equally important transmitter\nnorepinephrine by just this sort of transformation.  There is the\nenzymatic addition of an oxygen atom to the \"benzylic\" position of\ndopamine.  And identical chemistry goes on with tyramine in a number\nof plants and animals, with a similar addition of oxygen to form\noctopamine, so-named for its discovered presence in the salivary\nglands of Octopus vulgaris.  In the first explorations in the \"OX\"\nseries, this oxygen was intentionally blocked with a methyl group, to\nease its entry into the brain, and increase the possibilities of its\nbeing active as a psychedelic.  As mentioned above, the \"D\" in \"OD\"\nfollows from its ring orientation pattern being the same as that of\n2C-D (and this, originally from the mimicking of the pattern of DOM).\nAll of these D- compounds have the 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl\nring-substitution pattern.\n\n\nAn interesting complication is also part of this structure package.\nThe added methoxy group (or hydroxy group, see recipe for BOHD) also\nadds a new asymmetric center, allowing for the eventual separation of\nthe material into two optical isomers.  And at such time as the\ncorresponding amphetamine homologues might be made and studied, the\npresence of yet another chiral center (under the alpha-methyl group)\nwill demand that there be actually two racemic compounds synthesized,\nand a total of four isomers to contend with, if really careful and\nthorough work is to be done.\n\n\nA parallel chemistry to all of this follows the addition of sodium\nethoxide (rather than sodium methoxide) to the nitrostyrene.  The\nfinal product, then, is the ethoxy homologue\n2,5-dimethoxy-beta-ethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or BOED.  It is down in\nhuman potency by a factor of three, with a normal dosage being 70-75\nmilligrams.  It has a ten hour duration, and is both anorexic and\ndiuretic.  There have been no visual effects or insights reported, but\nrather simply a highly intoxicated state.\n\n\nTwo synonyms, two definitions, and an expression of admiration.  The\nword norepinephrine is synonymous with noradrenalin, and the word\nepinephrine is synonymous with adrenalin.  The distinctions are that\nthe first in each case is American and the second British.  And the\nterm \"chiral\" indicates a potential asymmetry in a molecule that would\nallow eventual separation into two optical isomers.  The term\n\"racemic\" refers to a mixture of these two isomers which has not yet\nbeen separated into the individual components.  A racemic mixture is\ncalled a racemate and, from the point of view of the human animal\n(which is completely asymmetric), must be considered as a mixture of\ntwo structurally identical but optically mirror-image isomers, which\ncan be potentially separated and which will certainly have different\npharmacologies.  And the admiration?  This is directed to the explorer\nwho ventured close enough to an octopus to locate its salivary glands\nand to discover a phenethylamine there!",

The replacement of the\n2-position oxygen of DOM with a sulfur atom (to give 2-TOM) dropped\nthe potency by a factor of 15x, and the replacement of the 5-position\noxygen with a sulfur atom (to give 5-TOM) dropped the potency by a\nfactor of about 10x.  It would be a logical calculation that the\nreplacement of both oxygen atoms with sulfur might drop the potency by\na factor of 150x.  So, with DOM being active at maybe 5 milligrams, a\nlogical prediction of the active level of BIS-TOM would be 750\nmilligrams.  And maybe this would be the right level, but with the\nhints of neurological disturbance that seemed to be there at 160 mg,\nthere was no desire to go up by a factor of five again.  The rewards\nwould simply not be worth the risks.\n\n\nThe 2-carbon analogue, 2C-BIS-TOM, was prepared from the intermediate\naldehyde above, first by reaction with nitromethane to give the\nnitrostyrene as tomato-colored crystals from EtOAc, mp 145-146 °C.\nAnal.

This was reduced with AH to give\n2,5-bis-(methylthio)-4-methylphenethylamine hydrochloride as\nivory-colored crystals with a mp of 273-277 °C.\n\n\nAlthough there are many interesting psychedelic drugs with sulfur\natoms in them (the TOM's, the TOET's, the ALEPH's and all of the\n2C-T's), there just aren't many that contain two sulfur atoms.\nBIS-TOM bombed out, and 2C-BIS-TOM remains untried, but will probably\nalso fail, as the phenethylamines are rarely more potent than the\ncorresponding amphetamines.  This leaves 2C-T-14 as the remaining\nhope, and its synthesis is still underway.",

It is clear that the adding of an N-methyl group onto DOM\ncertainly cuts down the activity by a factor of ten-fold, and even\nthen results in something that is not completely good.  Three\nmilligrams of DOM is a winner, but even ten times this, thirty\nmilligrams of N-methyl-DOM, is somewhat fuzzy.  In the rabbit\nhyperthermia studies, this compound was some 25 times less active than\nDOM, so even animal tests say this is way down there in value.  This\nparticular measure suggests that the active level in man might be 75\nmilligrams.  Well, maybe, but I am not at all comfortable in trying it\nat that level.  In fact I do not intend to explore this any further\nwhatsoever, unless there is a compelling reason, and I see no such\nreason.  For the moment, let us leave this one to others, who might be\nmore adventurous but less discriminating.\n\n\nIn browsing through my notes I discovered that I had made another\nN-substitution product of DOM.

    description: "How does one discover a new drug for a\nmalady that does not exist in experimental animals?  Drugs that\ninterfere with sleep, or with appetite, or with some infecting\nbacterium, are naturals for animal screening, in that animals sleep,\neat, and can be easily infected.  But there are lots of syndromes that\ninvolve a state of mind, and these are uniquely human.  Many of the\npsychopharmacological anti-this or anti-that agents address ailments\nsuch as anxiety, psychosis, paranoia, or depression, which are only\nknown in man.  So how does one discover a new drug in areas such as\nthese?  If one has in hand a drug that is known to be effective in one\nof these human ailments, an animal assay can be set up to give some\nmeasurable response to that specific drug, or a biochemical property\ncan be rationalized as being related to a mechanism of action.  And\nwith the known drug as a calibration, and restricting your search to\nstructurally related compounds, you can find structural relatives that\ngive the same responses.\n\n\nBut how does one find a new class?  One way is to kind of stumble into\nit as a side-line of human experimentation with new psychedelics.  But\nit is really difficult to pick up the clues as to what will be a good\nanti-depressant if you are not depressed.  This compound, to which I\nhad given the name of ARIADNE as the first of my ten \"classic ladies\"\n(I'll say more about them later), was not really a stimulant of any\nkind, certainly it was not a psychedelic, and yet there was something\nthere.  It had been explored rather extensively as a potential\npsychotherapeutic ally by a friend of mine.  He said that there seemed\nto be some value in a few of his patients who had some underlying\ndepression, but not much of anything with the others.  So, I decided\nto call it an anti-depressant.  I had mentioned some of this history\none time when I was giving an address at a conference on the East\nCoast, and my host (who happened to be the research director at a\nlarge pharmaceutical house) asked if I would send him a sample.  His\ncompany did many animal tests, one of which showed that it was not\nhallucinogenic (a cat whose tail erected dramatically with DOM did\nnothing with ARIADNE) and another that showed re-motivation (some old\nmaze-running monkeys who had decided not to run any more mazes changed\ntheir minds with ARIADNE).\n\n\nSo patents were obtained for the \"R\" isomer, the more effective\nisomer, covering its use for such things as the restoring of\nmotivation in senile geriatric patients.  And a tradename of\nDimoxamine was assigned it, despite several voices that held out for\nAriadnamine.  But it didn't have what was needed to make it all the\nway to the commercial market\n\n\nMany, many analogues of ARIADNE have been made, and for a variety of\nreasons.  In the industrial world there is research backup carried\nout, not only for the discovery of new things, but also for patent\nprotection of old things.  Several dozen analogues of ARIADNE have\nbeen made and pharmacologically evaluated, and some of them have been\nput into the published literature.  The major points of variation have\nbeen two: keep the 4-position methyl group intact, and make the\nvariations on the alpha-carbon (propyl, butyl, dimethyl, phenyl,\nbenzyl, phenethyl, etc.--an extensive etc.) or: keep the\nalpha-position ethyl group intact and make the variations on the\n4-position (chloro, iodo, methylthio, carboxy, etc.--again, an\nextensive etc.).\n\n\nSome of these analogues I had made, and sent in for animal screening.\nThe high potency of DOB suggested the bromo-counterpart of ARIADNE.\nThe making of this entailed the proteo counterpart,\n1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane.  Reaction of\n2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde with nitropropane in benzene in a Dean Stark\napparatus with cyclohexylamine as a catalyst produced\n1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitrobutene, which crystallized as orange\ncrystals from MeOH with a mp of 47-47.5 °C.  Anal. (C12H15NO4) C,H,N.\nThis was reduced to the amine 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane\nwith LAH in ether, and this gave a hydrochloride salt with a mp of\n172-174 °C after recrystallization from acetonitrile.  The free base\nof this compound was brominated in acetic acid to give\n1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminobutane which yielded a white\nhydrochloride salt with a mp of 204-206 °C following recrystallization\nfrom IPA.  The isomeric non-brominated analogue,\n1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane was made and explored by the\nChemical Warfare group at Edgewood Arsenal; its code number is\nEA-1322.\n\n\nSeveral of the alpha-ethyl analogues of ARIADNE were N,N-dialkylated,\nand were target compounds for halogenation with radio-iodine or\nradio-fluorine, for evaluation as potential brain blood-flow\nindicators.  In these studies. all examples followed a common flow\ndiagram.  The reaction of the appropriate benzaldehyde and\nnitropropane, using N,N-dimethylethylenediamine as a catalyst and\nfollowing recrystallization from MeOH, gave the corresponding\n1-aromatic-2-nitro-1-butene (the nitrostyrene) which, by reduction\nwith elemental iron, gave the corresponding 2-butanone (which was\ndistilled at about 0.3 mm/Hg).  This led, by reductive amination with\ndimethylamine hydrochloride and sodium cyanoborohydride, to the\ncorresponding N,N-dimethyl product which was distilled at about 0.3\nmm/Hg and which, in no case, either formed a solid HCl salt or reacted\nwith carbon dioxide from the air.  From 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, the\nnitrostyrene appeared as yellow crystals, the ketone as a white oil,\nand the product N,N-dimethyl-1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane as\na white oil.  From 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, the nitrostyrene formed\nbright yellow crystal, the ketone was an off-white oil, and the\nproduct N,N-dimethyl-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane was a white\noil.  From 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, the nitrostyrene formed pale\nyellow crystals that discolored on exposure to the light, the ketone\nwas an off-white clear oil, and the product\nN,N-dimethyl-1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane was a white oil.\nFrom 2,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, the nitrostyrene was obtained as\norange crystals, and was not pursued further.\n\n\nA number of ARIADNE analogues have been made, or at least started,\npurely to serve as probes into whatever new areas of\npsychopharmacological activity might be uncovered.  One of these is a\nHOT compound, and one is a TOM compound, and a couple of them are the\npseudo (or near-pseudo) orientations.  The HOT analogue was made from\nthe nitrostyrene precursor to ARIADNE itself, reduced not with LAH or\nAH (which would give the primary amine), but rather with sodium\nborohydride and borane dimethylsulfide.  The product,\n1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-N-hydroxy-2-aminobutane\nhydrochloride, was a white crystalline material. The 5-TOM analogue\ngot as far as the nitrostyrene.  This was made from\n2-methoxy-4-methyl-5-(methylthio)benzaldehyde (see under the 5-TOM\nrecipe for its preparation) and nitropropane in acetic acid, and gave\nbright yellow crystals.  The true pseudo-analogue is the\n2,4,6-trimethoxy material based on TMA-6, which is the \"real\"\npseudo-TMA-2.  The nitrostyrene from 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and\nnitropropane crystallized from MeOH/CH3CN as fine yellow crystals, and\nthis was reduced with AH in cold THF to\n1-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane which was a bright, white\npowder.\n\n\nAnd the near-pseudo analogue?\n\n\nFirst, what is near-pseudo?  I have explained already that the\n\"normal\" world of substitution patterns is the 2,4,5.  Everyone knows\nthat that is the most potent pattern.  But, the 2,4,6 is in many ways\nequipotent, and has been named the pseudo-stuff.  The \"real,\" or\n\"true\" pseudo-stuff.  So what is the \"near\" pseudo-stuff?  I am\nwilling to bet that the rather easily obtained 2,3,6-trisubstitution\npattern, and the much more difficult to obtain 2,3,5-substitution\npattern, will produce treasures every bit as unexpected and remarkable\nas either the 2,4,5- or the 2,4,6- counterparts.  These are neither\n\"real\" nor \"pseudo,\" but something else, and I will find a name for\nthem when the time comes, something weird from the Greek alphabet.\nAnd this will double again the range of possible exploration.  The\nTMA-5 analogue mentioned came from 2,3,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and\nnitropropane using cyclohexylamine as a catalyst (yellow-orange\nsolids) which was reduced to the amine with AH.  This hydrochloride\nsalt is an air-stable white powder.  All of these materials remain\nunexplored.\n\n\nSomewhere in the wealth of compounds implicit in the many structural\nvariables possible (the normal versus the pseudo versus the\nnear-pseudo patterns, coupled with the wide variety of promising\nsubstituents that can be placed on the 4-position, together with the\navailability of the the unexplored members of the Ten Classic Ladies\nharem), it would seem inescapable that interesting compounds will\nemerge.\n\n\nJust what is this all about the ten \"Classic Ladies?\" In the chemical\nstruc-ture of DOM, there is a total of nineteen hydrogen atoms.  Some\nof these are indis-tinguishable from others, such as the three\nhydrogen atoms on a methyl group.  But there are exactly ten \"types\"\nof hydrogen atoms present.  And, not having much, if any, intuition as\nto just why DOM was so powerful a psychedelic, I decided to\nsystematically replace each of the ten unique hydrogens, one at a time\nof course, with a methyl group.  And I planned to give the resulting\nmaterials the names of famous ladies, alphabetically, as you walk\naround the molecule.\n\n\nARIADNE was the first of these, the methyl for a hydrogen atom on the\nmethyl group of the amphetamine chain.  It was Ariadne who gave the\nlong piece of thread to Theseus to guide him through the mazes of the\nLabyrinth so he could escape after killing the Minotaur.  The record\nis fuzzy as to whether, after the successful killing, she went with\nhim, or let him go on alone.  A methyl group on the nitrogen atom\nproduced BEATRICE.  There is the legendary Beatrijs of the Dutch\nreligious literature of the 14th century, and there is the Beatrice\nfrom Beatrice and Benedict (of Berlioz fame).  But the one I had in\nmind was the lady from Florence whom Dante immortalized in the Divina\nCommedia, and she is entered under her own name in this footnote.\nReplacing the alpha-hydrogen of DOM with a methyl group would give the\nphentermine analogue which is named CHARMIAN.  You may be thinking of\nCleopatra's favorite attendant, but I was thinking of the sweet wife\nof a very dear friend of mine, a lady who has been in a state of\ngentle schizophrenia for some forty years now.  The MDA analogue of\nCHARMIAN has been described in this foornote under the code name of\nMDPH.  CHARMIAN, herself, has been synthesized and is of very much\nreduced potency in animals, as compared to DOM.  It has not been tried\nin man as far as I know.\n\n\nThe two beta-hydrogen atoms of DOM are distinct in that, upon being\nreplaced with methyl groups, one would produce a threo-isomer, and the\nother an erythro-isomer.  I have named them DAPHNE (who escaped from\nApollo by becoming a laurel tree which was, incidentally, named for\nher) and ELVIRA (who might not be too well known classically, but\nwhose name has been attached to Mozart's 21st piano concerto as its\nslow movement was used as theme music for the movie Elvira Madigan).\nI don't know if either of this pair has been made--I started and got\nas far as the cis-trans mixture of adducts betweeen nitroethane and\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylacetophenone.  Whoever finally makes them gets\nto assign the names.  I had made and tested the corresponding\nhomologues of DMMDA that correspond to these two ladies.\n\n\nAnd there are five positions (2,3,4,5 and 6) around the aromatic ring,\neach of which either carries a hydrogen atom or a methyl group that\nhas a hydrogen atom.  There is the 2-methoxy group which can become a\n2-ethoxy group to produce a compound called FLORENCE.  Her name is the\nEnglish translation of the Italian Firenze, a city that, although\nhaving a female name, has always seemed thoroughly masculine to me.\nThere is the 3-hydrogen atom which can become a 3-methyl group to\nproduce a compound called GANESHA.  This is a fine elephant-headed\nIndian God who is the symbol of worldly wisdom and also has been seen\nas the creator of obstacles.  Here I really blew it; the Classic Lady\nturned out to be a Classic Gentle-man; not even the name is feminine.\nThere is the 4-methyl group which can become a 4-ethyl group to\nproduce a compound called HECATE who presided over magic arts and\nspells.  There is the 5-methoxy group which can become a 5-ethoxy\ngroup to produce a compound called IRIS, who is the Goddess of the\nrainbow.  And there is the 6-hydrogen atom which can become a 6-methyl\ngroup to produce a compound called JUNO, who is pretty much a lady's\nlady, or should I say a woman's woman.\n\n\nGANESHA, 2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-dimethylamphetamine has been made, and has\nproven to be an extraordinary starting point for a large series of\npotent phenethylamines and amphetamines which are described in this\nbook.  HECATE was given a synonym early in this process, and is now\nknown as DOET (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine).  IRIS has also been\nentered under her name, and the other ethoxy homologue, FLORENCE,\nwould be easily made based on the preparation of the phenethylamine\nanalogue, 2CD-2ETO.

    description: "This drug was the first definition of the\nterm, Beth state.\n\n\nThere is something of the Fournier Transform in any and all drug\nexperiments.  A psychedelic drug experience is a complex combination\nof many signals going all at the same time.  Something like the sound\nof an oboe playing the notes of the A-major scale.  There are events\nthat occur in sequence, such as the initial A, followed by B, followed\nby C-sharp and on and on.  That is the chronology of the experience,\nand it can be written down as a series of perceived phenomena.  The\nnotes of the scale.  Black quarter notes, with flags at the tops of\ntheir staffs, going up the page of music.\n\n\nBut within each of these single events, during the sounding of the\nnote \"A,\" for example, there is a complex combination of harmonics\nbeing produced at the same time, including all components from the\nfundamental oscillation on up through all harmonics into the\ninaudible.  This mixture defines the played instrument as being an\noboe.  Each component may be shared by many instruments, but the\nparticular combination is the unique signature of the oboe.\n\n\nThis analogy applies precisely to the study of psychedelic drugs and\ntheir actions.  Each drug has a chronology of effect, like the notes\nof the A-major scale.  But there are many components of a drug's\naction, like the harmonics from the fundamental to the inaudible\nwhich, taken in concert, defines the drug.  With musical instruments,\nthese components can be shown as sine waves on an oscilloscope.  One\ncomponent, 22%, was a sine wave at a frequency of 1205 cycles, and a\nphase angle of +55!.  But in psychopharmacology?  There is no psychic\noscillo-scope.  There are no easily defined and measured harmonics or\nphase angles.  Certainly, any eventual definition of a drug will\nrequire some such dissection into components each of which makes some\ncontribution to the complex whole.  The mental process may some day be\ndefined by a particular combination of these components.  And one of\nthem is this Beth state.  It is a state of uncaring, of anhe-donia,\nand of emotionlessness.\n\n\nMany drugs have a touch of this Beth state, ALEPH-7 more than most.\nIf a sufficient alphabet of effects (I am using the Alephs, Beths,\nGimels, and Daleths of the Hebrew as token starters only) were to be\naccumulated and defined, the actions of new materials might someday be\nmore exactly documented.  Could depression, euphoria, and\ndisinhibition for example, all be eventually seen as being made up of\ntheir component parts, each contributing in some measured way to the\nsum, to the human experience?  The psychologists of the world would be\necstatic.  And drugs such as ALEPH-7 might be useful in helping to\ndefine one of these parts.",

The beauty of putting a whole new ring into an active\nstructure is that it provides a marvelous vehicle for introducing new\nsubstituents in new arrangements.  Had Aleph-6 been a cleanly active\nand potent compound, then the new phenyl group could have been made\nelectronegative to varying degrees (with methoxy substitution for\nexample) or electropositive to varying degrees (with trifluoromethyls\nor nitros) and this fine-tuning could have been extremely rewarding.\n\n\nBut this material had the earmarks of one of those forever threshold\nthings.  The 40 milligram experiment was hopelessly compromised, and\nnothing higher was ever scheduled or tried.  The two-carbon homologue,\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-phenylthiophenethylamine, or 2C-T-6, has never even\nbeen synthesized, let alone assayed.",

    description: "As with ALEPH itself, and in most ways with\nthe entire ALEPH family, there is no predictability of the\ndose/response relationship.  One person had expressed his psychic\nisolation by taking and maintaining a fetal position in relative\nhibernation for several hours and with substantial amnesia; this at a\nfour milligram dose.  Yet another person, at fully twice this amount,\nwas aware of a slight light-headedness that could in no way be\nmeasured as more than a bare threshold.  But by the time this erratic\nnature had become apparent, the ALEPHS had been assigned and made, up\nto and including ALEPH-7.\n\n\nALEPH-3 was intended to be the methallylthio compound,\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(beta-methallylthio)amphetamine.  The thioether\n(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl beta-methallyl sulfide) was easily made from\n2,5-dimethoxythiophenol (see 2C-T-2 for its preparation) with 3.4 g\ndissolved in a solution of 1.7 g KOH in 25 mL boiling EtOH, and 2.72 g\nmethallyl chloride, heated 1 h on the steam bath, poured into 250 mL\nH2O, extracted with 3x100 mL CH2Cl2, and solvent removal yielding 4.4\ng of the sulfide as an amber oil.  An effort to convert this to\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(beta-methallylthio)benzaldehyde (7.2 g POCl3, 6.7 g\nN-methylformanilide, 4.2 g of the crude sulfide from above, 15 min\nheating on the steam bath, H2O hydrolysis, hexane extraction of the\nresidues from a CH2Cl2 extraction) produced 3.1 g of a\npeppermint-smelling oil that distilled at 140-160 °C at 0.3 mm/Hg and\nwhich did indeed have an aldehyde group present (by proton NMR) but\nthe rest of the spectrum was a mess, and the project was abandoned.\n\n\nSeveral years later, this entire project was reinitiated, and the\naldehyde was obtained as a yellow crystal, but again it was not\npursued.  At that time, the earlier try had been totally forgotten,\nand a brand new ALEPH- (or 2C-T-) number had been assigned; i.e., 20.\nThus, the corresponding phenethylamine\n(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(beta-methallylthio)phenethylamine), had it ever been\nmade, which it was not, would have been called either 2C-T-3 or\n2C-T-20, and the amphetamine homologue would probably have been\nALEPH-20.\n\n\nA closely related 2C-T-X compound was also started quite a while later\n--this was the allylthio homologue of the methallyl material 2C-T-3 or\n2C-T-20.  Its place in the flow of things is evident from its\nnumbering, 2C-T-16.  A mixture of 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and KOH and\nallyl chloride in MeOH gave 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl allyl sulfide as a\nwhite oil which boiled at 110-125 °C at 0.25 mm/Hg.  This, with POCl3\nand N-methylformanilide provided\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-(allylthio)benzaldehyde which distilled at 140-160 °C\nat 0.4 mm/Hg and could be recrystallized from MeOH as a pale yellow\nsolid.  Reaction of this aldehyde in nitroethane in the presence of\nammonium acetate (steam bath for 2.5 h) provided\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-allylthio-beta-nitrostyrene as red crystals from\nacetonitrile.  Its mp was 114-115 °C.  Anal. (C13H15NO4S) C,H. This\nhas not yet been reduced to the final amine,\n2,5-dimethoxy-4-allylthiophenethylamine, 2C-T-16.  The corresponding\namphetamine would be, of course, ALEPH-16.\n\n\nALEPH-5 was to be the cyclohexylthio analogue\n(2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclohexylthioamphetamine).  The thioether\n(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl cyclohexyl sulfide) was successfully made from\n1.7 g 85% KOH pellets in 25 mL hot EtOH, 3.4 g 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol\n(again, see under 2C-T-2 for its preparation), and 4.9 g cyclohexyl\nbromide, 3 h on the steam bath, into 500 mL H2O, extraction with 3x100\nmL CH2Cl2, washing the extracts with 5% NaOH, and evaporation to yield\n5.2 g of an amber oil.  The aldehyde, (made from 6.1 g POCl3 and 5.4 g\nN-methylformanilide, heated until claret colored, then treated with\n5.0 g of the above crude thioether, heating for 20 min on the steam\nbath, into 300 mL H2O, and over-night stirring) was obtained as 3.1 g\nof a flesh-colored solid that was clearly neither pure nor completely\ncorrect.  Repeated partitioning with organic solvents and cooling and\nscratching the residues finally provided a pale orange crystal (1.3 g,\nmp 88-93 °C) which, after twice recrystallizing from MeOH, gave 0.4 g\nof pale yellow crystals with a mp 95-96 °C and a textbook perfect NMR\nin CDCl3 (CHO, 1H (s) 10.41; ArH 2H (s) 6.93, 7.31; OCH3, 6H, (2s) at\n3.88 and 3.92; CH, 1H br. at 3.34; and (CH2)5 10H br. at 1.20-2.34).\nThe nitrostyrene was prepared from 200 mg of the above aldehyde in 1.2\nmL nitroethane and 0.1 g ammonium acetate overnight on the steam bath,\nthe solvent removed to give an orange oil that spontaneously\ncrystallized after a few months' standing.  This was never\ncharacterized, but sits there on the shelf to be reduced to ALEPH-5\nsome inspired day.  The two-carbon homo-logue of this\n(2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclohexylthiophenethylamine) will someday be called\n2C-T-5 (if it is ever made).\n\n\nThe remaining members of this family, ALEPH-4, ALEPH-6, and ALEPH-7\nhave actually been prepared and they have all been entered here in\nBook II, under their own names.",

    description: "This specific compound is probably the\nfirst sulfur-containing phenethylamine to have been evaluated as a\npotentially active CNS stimulant or psychedelic.  It was a complete,\ntotal, absolute unknown.  The first trials were made at the\nsub-microgram level, specifically at 0.25 micrograms, at 11:30 AM on\nSeptember 3, 1975.  Part of this extreme precaution was due to the\nuniqueness of a new heteroatom in a phenethylamine system.  But part\nwas due to the strange manic excitement that occurred at the time of\nthe isolation and characterizing of the final product in the\nlaboratory.  Although it was certainly all placebo response, I was\njumpy and unable to stay in the lab for more than a few minutes at a\ntime.  Maybe dust in the air?  Maybe some skin contact with the free\nbase?  Now, I know there was nothing, but the possibility of\nextraordinary potency was real, and I did indeed wash everything down\nanyway.  In fact, it took a total of 18 trials to work the\nexperimental dosage up to as much as a single milligram.  In\nretrospect, overly cautious.  But retrospection, as they say, is\ncheap.\n\n\nThe 5 milligram experiment, briefly quoted from above, is the stuff of\nChapter 14 of this book, important in that it gives an interesting\nexample of some thought processes associated with psychedelic\nintoxication, ego-inflation, and what might be thought of as bits of\nmania.  As is always the case with peak experiences that happen to be\ncatalyzed by drugs, this extraordinary event could not be duplicated.\nAt 7 milligrams there was an uneventful +1, and some 10 milligrams was\nneeded to generate a full +3 experience.  The first clue of the\nerratic nature of the Aleph family came from an independent assay by a\ncolleague of mine, one who was very familiar with such states of\nconsciousness, but for whom this was not a time for peak experiences.\nAt 10 milligrams he told me that he had had only mild effects which he\nfound relatively uninteresting.\n\n\nAs it stands, ALEPH remains relatively unexplored.  Its two positional\nisomers are entered here as ORTHO-DOT and META-DOT.  Three higher\nhomologues have been more thoroughly looked at, and the generic name\nALEPH (the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) was given this group\non the basis that they might have extraordinary properties in common.\nBut the real treasure came in the exploring of the 2-carbon\nhomologues, the compounds that make up the 2C-T family.  Here, there\nproved to be much less uncertainty as to reasonable dosages, and much\nmore richness in the subjective nature of the experience.",

Some effects persisted\nfor more than 12 hours.  Dosages above 35 milligrams remain\nunexplored.\n\n\nAs AL is one of the most potent 3,4,5-trisubstituted phenethylamines\nyet described, and since the corresponding amphetamines are of yet\ngreater potency, it would be a good guess that\n4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (3C-AL) would be an interesting\ncompound to explore.

    description: "The extension of the two-carbon chain of\nmescaline by alpha-methylation to the three carbon chain of TMA\napproximately doubled the potency of the compound.  And it was felt to\nbe a completely logical possibility that, by extending it one more\ncarbon atom, to the four carbon chain of alpha-ethyl-mescaline, it\nmight double again.  And following that logical progression, the\ndoubling of potency with each additional carbon atom, the factor would\nbe 2 to the 7th power by the alpha-octyl (or 256x that of mescaline,\nor a milligram as active dose) and with a side chain of a 70-carbon\nalkyl group (alpha-heptacontylmescaline) it would take just a single\nmolecule to be intoxicating.  This was rich fantasy stuff.  As an\nactive compound, just where would it go in the brain?  With an\n80-carbon side-chain, would one-thousandth of a single molecule be\nenough for a person?  Or might a single molecule intoxicate a thousand\npeople?  And how long a chain on the alpha-position might be\nsufficient that, by merely writing down the structure on a piece of\npaper, you would get high?  Maybe just conceiving the structure in\nyour mind would do it.
